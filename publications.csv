Highly informative natural scene regions increase microsaccade production during visual scanning.,"Classical image statistics, such as contrast, entropy, and the correlation between central and nearby pixel intensities, are thought to guide ocular fixation targeting. However, these statistics are not necessarily task relevant and therefore do not provide a complete picture of the relationship between informativeness and ocular targeting. Moreover, it is not known whether either informativeness or classical image statistics affect microsaccade production; thus, the role of microsaccades in information acquisition is also unknown. The objective quantification of the informativeness of a scene region is a major challenge, because it can vary with both image features and the task of the viewer. Thus, previous definitions of informativeness suffered from subjectivity and inconsistency across studies. Here we developed an objective measure of informativeness based on fixation consistency across human observers, which accounts for both bottom-up and top-down influences in ocular targeting. We then analyzed fixations in more versus less informative image regions in relation to classical statistics. Observers generated more microsaccades on more informative than less informative image regions, and such regions also exhibited low redundancy in their classical statistics. Increased microsaccade production was not explained by increased fixation duration, suggesting that the visual system specifically uses microsaccades to heighten information acquisition from informative regions.","McCamy, Michael B (https://www.notion.so/McCamy-Michael-B-34d643bcb56144cc85e9cb3165ba1192?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Di Stasi, Leandro L (https://www.notion.so/Di-Stasi-Leandro-L-fb897f8222fc4f3a821781f1682fb6a3?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","McCamy, Otero-Millan, Di Stasi, Macknik, Martinez-Conde",Ocular motor control,"J Neurosci. 2014 Feb 19;34(8):2956-66.

Magnetic Vestibular Stimulation (MVS) As a Technique for Understanding the Normal and Diseased Labyrinth.,"Humans often experience dizziness and vertigo around strong static magnetic fields such as those present in an MRI scanner. Recent evidence supports the idea that this effect is the result of inner ear vestibular stimulation and that the mechanism is a magnetohydrodynamic force (Lorentz force) that is generated by the interactions between normal ionic currents in the inner ear endolymph and the strong static magnetic field of MRI machines. While in the MRI, the Lorentz force displaces the cupula of the lateral and anterior semicircular canals, as if the head was rotating with a constant acceleration. If a human subject's eye movements are recorded when they are in darkness in an MRI machine (i.e., without fixation), there is a persistent nystagmus that diminishes but does not completely disappear over time. When the person exits the magnetic field, there is a transient aftereffect (nystagmus beating in the opposite direction) that reflects adaptation that occurred in the MRI. This magnetic vestibular stimulation (MVS) is a useful technique for exploring set-point adaptation, the process by which the brain adapts to a change in its environment, which in this case is vestibular imbalance. Here, we review the mechanism of MVS, how MVS produces a unique stimulus to the labyrinth that allows us to explore set-point adaptation, and how this technique might apply to the understanding and treatment of vestibular and other neurological disorders.","Ward, Bryan K (https://www.notion.so/Ward-Bryan-K-4f440f4f82b64b5faf9300fa9ab9bae5?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Jareonsettasin, Prem (https://www.notion.so/Jareonsettasin-Prem-d43bfa10bbba43b499617087799f7ec3?pvs=21), Schubert, Michael (https://www.notion.so/Schubert-Michael-be9dd5934032430296fbd811266b54c6?pvs=21), Roberts, Dale C (https://www.notion.so/Roberts-Dale-C-1095dbbb31614cf49f3a8924321165b6?pvs=21), Zee, David S (https://www.notion.so/Zee-David-S-a54d8115dd39404fa3fbe60216ee1f7c?pvs=21)","Ward, Otero-Millan, Jareonsettasin, Schubert, Roberts, Zee",Ocular motor control,"Front Neurol. 2017 Apr 5;8:122.

Unsupervised clustering method to detect microsaccades.,"Abstract Microsaccades, small involuntary eye movements that occur once or twice per second during attempted visual fixation, are relevant to perception, cognition, and oculomotor control and present distinctive characteristics in visual and oculomotor pathologies. Thus, the development of robust and accurate microsaccade-detection techniques is important for basic and clinical neuroscience research. Due to the diminutive size of microsaccades, however, automatic and reliable detection can be difficult. Current challenges in microsaccade detection include reliance on set, arbitrary thresholds and lack of objective validation. Here we describe a novel microsaccade-detecting method, based on unsupervised clustering techniques, that does not require an arbitrary threshold and provides a detection reliability index. We validated the new clustering method using real and simulated eye-movement data. The clustering method reduced detection errors by 62% for binocular data and 78% for monocular data, when compared to standard contemporary microsaccade-detection techniques. Further, the clustering method's reliability index was correlated with the microsaccade-detection error rate, suggesting that the reliability index may be used to determine the comparative precision of eye-tracking devices.","Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Alba Castro, Jose Luis (https://www.notion.so/Alba-Castro-Jose-Luis-c5f46598a7204fffbc81fbad083a2dc8?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","Otero-Millan, Alba Castro, Macknik, Martinez-Conde",Measuring eye movements,"J Vis. 2014 Feb 25;14(2). pii: 18.

Spatial orientation: Model-based approach to multi-sensory mechanisms.,"Perception of spatial orientation is generated through multimodal sensory integration. In this process, there are systematic errors with changes in the head or body position, which reflect challenges for the brain in maintaining a common sensory reference frame for spatial orientation. Here, we focus on this multisensory aspect of spatial orientation. We review a Bayesian spatial perception model that can be used as a framework to study sensory contributions to spatial orientation during lateral head tilts and probe neural networks involved in this process.","Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21)","Kheradmand, Otero-Millan",Vision while moving,"Prog Brain Res. 2019;248:209-223.

Abnormal Capillary Vasodynamics Contribute to Ictal Neurodegeneration in Epilepsy.,"Seizure-driven brain damage in epilepsy accumulates over time, especially in the hippocampus, which can lead to sclerosis, cognitive decline, and death. Excitotoxicity is the prevalent model to explain ictal neurodegeneration. Current labeling technologies cannot distinguish between excitotoxicity and hypoxia, however, because they share common molecular mechanisms. This leaves open the possibility that undetected ischemic hypoxia, due to ictal blood flow restriction, could contribute to neurodegeneration previously ascribed to excitotoxicity. We tested this possibility with Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (CLE) and novel stereological analyses in several models of epileptic mice. We found a higher number and magnitude of NG2+ mural-cell mediated capillary constrictions in the hippocampus of epileptic mice than in that of normal mice, in addition to spatial coupling between capillary constrictions and oxidative stressed neurons and neurodegeneration. These results reveal a role for hypoxia driven by capillary blood flow restriction in ictal neurodegeneration.","Leal-Campanario, Rocio (https://www.notion.so/Leal-Campanario-Rocio-53bf212662f34fc0bd7f9bbd90b1ad13?pvs=21), Alarcon-Martinez, Luis (https://www.notion.so/Alarcon-Martinez-Luis-84db299266354caeb4ae9f4eefda5d14?pvs=21), Rieiro, Hector (https://www.notion.so/Rieiro-Hector-e89e6af39ca04eb8b787d075dc50553e?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21), Alarcon-Martinez, Tugba (https://www.notion.so/Alarcon-Martinez-Tugba-a19fcad4af0c418c918a946c090a488a?pvs=21), Zhao, Xiaoli (https://www.notion.so/Zhao-Xiaoli-70bdd7c4b9e14be8936706666ac37d61?pvs=21), LaMee, J (https://www.notion.so/LaMee-J-d28c8d04dad543638a75fe9667691054?pvs=21), Popp, PJ (https://www.notion.so/Popp-PJ-162906cb4f254b608b7f3f6ea67836c1?pvs=21), Calhoun, ME (https://www.notion.so/Calhoun-ME-f84ab690950446a39b0b12bc48c5a24c?pvs=21), Arribas, Juan I (https://www.notion.so/Arribas-Juan-I-075377cdcec14f2fa330497d31b20b7f?pvs=21), Schlegel, Alex A (https://www.notion.so/Schlegel-Alex-A-d9659dee04424a37ba2d2d8922ddd788?pvs=21), Di Stasi, Leandro L (https://www.notion.so/Di-Stasi-Leandro-L-fb897f8222fc4f3a821781f1682fb6a3?pvs=21), Rho, JM (https://www.notion.so/Rho-JM-95346f06711c4df38a40a3179bddc1d5?pvs=21), Inge, L (https://www.notion.so/Inge-L-1e908bf8a68e4bbab7246ca969be906a?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Treiman, L (https://www.notion.so/Treiman-L-1058d349aa31497b9c0abae57e22c2dd?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21)","Leal-Campanario, Alarcon-Martinez, Rieiro, Martinez-Conde, Alarcon-Martinez, Zhao, LaMee, Popp, Calhoun, Arribas, Schlegel, Di Stasi, Rho, Inge, Otero-Millan, Treiman, Macknik",,"Sci Rep. 2017 Feb 27;7:43276.

Distinctive features of saccadic intrusions and microsaccades in progressive supranuclear palsy.,"The eyes do not stay perfectly still during attempted fixation; fixational eye movements and saccadic intrusions (SIs) continuously change the position of gaze. The most common type of SI, square-wave jerks (SWJs), consists of saccade pairs that appear purely horizontal on clinical inspection: the first saccade moves the eye away from the fixation target, and after a short interval, the second saccade brings it back toward the target. SWJs are prevalent in certain neurological disorders, including progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Here, we developed an objective method to identify SWJs. We found that SWJs are more frequent, larger, and more markedly horizontal in PSP patients than in healthy human subjects. Furthermore, the loss of a vertical component in fixational saccades and SWJs was the eye movement feature that best distinguished PSP patients from controls. We moreover determined that, in PSP patients and controls, the larger the saccade the more likely it was part of a SWJ. Furthermore, saccades produced by PSP patients had equivalent properties whether they were part of a SWJ or not, suggesting that normal fixational saccades (microsaccades) are rare in PSP. We propose that fixational saccades and SIs are generated by the same neural circuit and that, both in PSP patients and in controls, SWJs result from a coupling mechanism that generates a second corrective saccade shortly after a large fixation saccade. Because of brainstem and/or cerebellum impairment, fixational saccades in PSP are abnormally large and thus more likely to trigger a corrective saccade, giving rise to SWJs.","Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Serra, Alessandro (https://www.notion.so/Serra-Alessandro-411c7502967e40ef84d37a5cca8d7ef7?pvs=21), Leigh, R John (https://www.notion.so/Leigh-R-John-2e3b39c6e4874202b9a333d0a549efca?pvs=21), Troncoso, Xoana G (https://www.notion.so/Troncoso-Xoana-G-86bb7654556e4d7984201d435d2de17f?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","Otero-Millan, Serra, Leigh, Troncoso, Macknik, Martinez-Conde","Diagnosis, Ocular motor control","J Neurosci. 2011 Mar 23;31(12):4379-87.

Pendular Oscillation and Ocular Bobbing After Pontine Hemorrhage,"The pathophysiology of acute, vertical spontaneous eye movements following pontine hemorrhage is not well understood. Here, we present and discuss the video-oculography findings of a patient with acute pontine hemorrhage who developed vertical pendular oscillation and ocular bobbing while comatose. The amplitudes, peak velocities, frequency distribution, and phase planes (velocity versus position) of the eye movements were analyzed. The vertical pendular oscillation was rhythmic with a peak frequency of 1.7 Hz, but amplitudes (mean 1.9°, range 0.2-8.2°) and peak velocities (mean 20.6°/s; range 5.9-60.6°/sec) fluctuated. Overall, their peak velocities were asymmetric, faster with downward than upward. Higher peak velocities were seen with larger amplitudes (downward phase r = 0.95, p < 0.001; upward phase r = 0.91, p < 0.001) and with movements beginning at eye positions lower in the orbit (downward phase r = - 0.64, p < 0.001; upward phase r = - 0.86, p < 0.001). Interspersed were typical ocular bobbing waveforms with a fast (peak velocity 128.8°/s), large-amplitude (17.5°) downward movement, sometimes followed by a flat interphase interval (0.5 s) when the eye was nearly stationary, and then a slow return to mid-position with a decaying velocity waveform. To account for the presence and co-existence of pendular oscillations and bobbing, we present and discuss three hypothetical models, not necessarily mutually exclusive: (1) oscillations originating in the inferior olives due to disruption of the central tegmental tract(s); (2) unstable neural integrator function due to pontine cell group damage involving neurons involved in gaze-holding; (3) low-frequency saccadic intrusions following omnipause neuron damage.","Chang, Tzu Pu (https://www.notion.so/Chang-Tzu-Pu-42eea05a5f994ef7889ff462bcd175b5?pvs=21), Gold, Dan R (https://www.notion.so/Gold-Dan-R-3f7a72785d88433d8d3eb94a7055e782?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Huang, Bor-Ren (https://www.notion.so/Huang-Bor-Ren-e3b75491a1ed4297803e9a287dc865d6?pvs=21), Zee, David S (https://www.notion.so/Zee-David-S-a54d8115dd39404fa3fbe60216ee1f7c?pvs=21)","Chang, Gold, Otero-Millan, Huang, Zee",Diagnosis,Cerebellum. 2019 Dec 27.,"June 29, 2020 1:21 PM",10.1007/s12311-019-01086-6.,,,"Chang, Tzu Pu (https://www.notion.so/Chang-Tzu-Pu-42eea05a5f994ef7889ff462bcd175b5?pvs=21)",,Cerebellum,"April 22, 2021 2:22 PM",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12311-019-01086-6,,,,31883062,,,"December 27, 2019",,"Zee, David S (https://www.notion.so/Zee-David-S-a54d8115dd39404fa3fbe60216ee1f7c?pvs=21)",,Published🎉,,Diagnosis (https://www.notion.so/Diagnosis-dd0da3ca4a8a4aa689a28fb2c70ec623?pvs=21),Research article,2019,
Visual Fixation and Continuous Head Rotations Have Minimal Effect on Set-Point Adaptation to Magnetic Vestibular Stimulation.,"Background: Strong static magnetic fields such as those in an MRI machine can induce sensations of self-motion and nystagmus. The proposed mechanism is a Lorentz force resulting from the interaction between strong static magnetic fields and ionic currents in the inner ear endolymph that causes displacement of the semicircular canal cupulae. Nystagmus persists throughout an individual's exposure to the magnetic field, though its slow-phase velocity partially declines due to adaptation. After leaving the magnetic field an after effect occurs in which the nystagmus and sensations of rotation reverse direction, reflecting the adaptation that occurred while inside the MRI. However, the effects of visual fixation and of head shaking on this early type of vestibular adaptation are unknown., Methods: Three-dimensional infrared video-oculography was performed in six individuals just before, during (5, 20, or 60 min) and after (4, 15, or 20 min) lying supine inside a 7T MRI scanner. Trials began by entering the magnetic field in darkness followed 60 s later, either by light with visual fixation and head still, or by continuous yaw head rotations (2 Hz) in either darkness or light with visual fixation. Subjects were always placed in darkness 10 or 30 s before exiting the bore. In control conditions subjects remained in the dark with the head still for the entire duration., Results: In darkness with head still all subjects developed horizontal nystagmus inside the magnetic field, with slow-phase velocity partially decreasing over time. An after effect followed on exiting the magnet, with nystagmus in the opposite direction. Nystagmus was suppressed during visual fixation; however, after resuming darkness just before exiting the magnet, nystagmus returned with velocity close to the control condition and with a comparable after effect. Similar after effects occurred with continuous yaw head rotations while in the scanner whether in darkness or light., Conclusions: Visual fixation and sustained head shaking either in the dark or with fixation inside a strong static magnetic field have minimal impact on the short-term mechanisms that attempt to null unwanted spontaneous nystagmus when the head is still, so called VOR set-point adaptation. This contrasts with the critical influence of vision and slippage of images on the retina on the dynamic (gain and direction) components of VOR adaptation.","Ward, Bryan K (https://www.notion.so/Ward-Bryan-K-4f440f4f82b64b5faf9300fa9ab9bae5?pvs=21), Zee, David S (https://www.notion.so/Zee-David-S-a54d8115dd39404fa3fbe60216ee1f7c?pvs=21), Roberts, Dale C (https://www.notion.so/Roberts-Dale-C-1095dbbb31614cf49f3a8924321165b6?pvs=21), Schubert, Michael (https://www.notion.so/Schubert-Michael-be9dd5934032430296fbd811266b54c6?pvs=21), Perez-Fernandez, Nicolas (https://www.notion.so/Perez-Fernandez-Nicolas-1e97554a549342528425d10ce3715019?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21)","Ward, Zee, Roberts, Schubert, Perez-Fernandez, Otero-Millan",Vision while moving,"Front Neurol. 2019 Jan 22;9:1197.

"Visual perception of upright: Head tilt, visual errors and viewing eye.","BACKGROUND: Perception of upright is often assessed by aligning a luminous line to the subjective visual vertical (SVV).
OBJECTIVE: Here we investigated the effects of visual line rotation and viewing eye on SVV responses and whether there was any change with head tilt.
METHODS: SVV was measured using a forced-choice paradigm and by combining the following conditions in 22 healthy subjects: head position (20° left tilt, upright and 20° right tilt), viewing eye (left eye, both eyes and right eye) and direction of visual line rotation (clockwise [CW] and counter clockwise [CCW]).
RESULTS: The accuracy and precision of SVV responses were not different between the viewing eye conditions in all head positions (P> 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test). The accuracy of SVV responses was significantly different between the CW and CCW line rotations (p = 0.0001; Kruskal-Wallis test) and SVV was tilted in the same direction as the line rotation. This effect of line rotation was however not consistent across head tilts and was only present in the upright and right tilt head positions. The accuracy of SVV responses showed a higher variability among subjects in the left head tilt position with no significant difference between the CW and CCW line rotations (P> 0.05; post-hoc Dunn's test).
CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the challenges to the estimate of upright with head tilt, normal subjects did remarkably well irrespective of the viewing eye. The physiological significance of the asymmetry in the effect of line rotation between the head tilt positions is unclear but it may suggest suggests a lateralizing effect of head tilt on the visual perception of upright.","Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21), Gonzalez, G (https://www.notion.so/Gonzalez-G-22608f9506794d30aae33688bf867fb1?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Lasker, Adrian (https://www.notion.so/Lasker-Adrian-0c993fd939f449c58ed266d12473dacf?pvs=21)","Kheradmand, Gonzalez, Otero-Millan, Lasker",Vision while moving,"J Vestib Res. 2016;25(5-6):201-9.

Microsaccades restore the visibility of minute foveal targets.,"Stationary targets can fade perceptually during steady visual fixation, a phenomenon known as Troxler fading. Recent research found that microsaccades—small, involuntary saccades produced during attempted fixation—can restore the visibility of faded targets, both in the visual periphery and in the fovea. Because the targets tested previously extended beyond the foveal area, however, the ability of microsaccades to restore the visibility of foveally-contained targets remains unclear. Here, subjects reported the visibility of low-to-moderate contrast targets contained entirely within the fovea during attempted fixation. The targets did not change physically, but their visibility varied intermittently during fixation, in an illusory fashion (i.e., foveal Troxler fading). Microsaccade rates increased significantly before the targets became visible, and decreased significantly before the targets faded, for a variety of target contrasts. These results support previous research linking microsaccade onsets to the visual restoration of peripheral and foveal targets, and extend the former conclusions to minute targets contained entirely within the fovea. Our findings suggest that the involuntary eye movements produced during attempted fixation do not always prevent fading—in either the fovea or the periphery—and that microsaccades can restore perception, when fading does occur. Therefore, microsaccades are relevant to human perception of foveal stimuli.","Costela, Francisco M (https://www.notion.so/Costela-Francisco-M-333d3e8a16544a169f1bd5c6826b7534?pvs=21), McCamy, Michael B (https://www.notion.so/McCamy-Michael-B-34d643bcb56144cc85e9cb3165ba1192?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","Costela, McCamy, Macknik, Otero-Millan, Martinez-Conde","Ocular motor control, Vision while moving","PeerJ. 2013 Aug 1;1:e119.

Upright Perception and Ocular Torsion Change Independently during Head Tilt.,"We maintain a stable perception of the visual world despite continuous movements of our eyes, head and body. Perception of upright is a key aspect of such orientation constancy. Here we investigated whether changes in upright perception during sustained head tilt were related to simultaneous changes in torsional position of the eyes. We used a subjective visual vertical (SVV) task, modified to track changes in upright perception over time, and a custom video method to measure ocular torsion simultaneously. We tested 12 subjects in upright position, during prolonged (~15 min) lateral head tilts of 20 degrees, and also after the head returned to upright position. While the head was tilted, SVV drifted in the same direction as the head tilt (left tilt: -5.4 ± 1.4° and right tilt: +2.2 ± 2.1°). After the head returned to upright position, there was an SVV aftereffect with respect to the pre-tilt baseline, which was also in the same direction as the head tilt (left tilt: -3.9 ± 0.6° and right tilt: +2.55 ± 1.0°). Neither the SVV drift nor the SVV aftereffect were correlated with the changes in ocular torsion. Using the Bayesian spatial-perception model we show that the pattern of SVV drift and aftereffect in our results could be explained by a drift and an adaptation in sensory inputs that encode head orientation. The fact that ocular torsion (mainly driven by the otoliths) could not account for the perceptual changes suggests that neck proprioception could be the primary source of drift in upright perception during head tilt, and subsequently the aftereffect in upright position.","Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21)","Otero-Millan, Kheradmand",Vision while moving,Front Hum Neurosci. 2016 Nov 17;10:573. eCollection 2016.,"June 29, 2020 1:21 PM",,,,"Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21)",,Front Hum Neurosci,"April 22, 2021 8:44 PM",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5112230/,,,,27909402,,,"November 17, 2016",,"Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21)",,Published🎉,,Vision while moving (https://www.notion.so/Vision-while-moving-e5fbfa2036ad40b3b8e4a7a1a95f4a08?pvs=21),Research article,2016,
"Saccades and microsaccades during visual fixation, exploration, and search: foundations for a common saccadic generator.","Microsaccades are known to occur during prolonged visual fixation, but it is a matter of controversy whether they also happen during free-viewing. Here we set out to determine: 1) whether microsaccades occur during free visual exploration and visual search, 2) whether microsaccade dynamics vary as a function of visual stimulation and viewing task, and 3) whether saccades and microsaccades share characteristics that might argue in favor of a common saccade–microsaccade oculomotor generator. Human subjects viewed naturalistic stimuli while performing various viewing tasks, including visual exploration, visual search, and prolonged visual fixation. Their eye movements were simultaneously recorded with high precision. Our results show that microsaccades are produced during the fixation periods that occur during visual exploration and visual search. Microsaccade dynamics during free-viewing moreover varied as a function of visual stimulation and viewing task, with increasingly demanding tasks resulting in increased microsaccade production. Moreover, saccades and microsaccades had comparable spatiotemporal characteristics, including the presence of equivalent refractory periods between all pair-wise combinations of saccades and microsaccades. Thus our results indicate a microsaccade–saccade continuum and support the hypothesis of a common oculomotor generator for saccades and microsaccades.","Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Troncoso, Xoana G (https://www.notion.so/Troncoso-Xoana-G-86bb7654556e4d7984201d435d2de17f?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), Serrano-Pedraza, Ignacio (https://www.notion.so/Serrano-Pedraza-Ignacio-6e360fff83e94595ad3beb343acaf05f?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","Otero-Millan, Troncoso, Macknik, Serrano-Pedraza, Martinez-Conde",Ocular motor control,"J Vis. 2008 Dec 18;8(14):21.1-18.

Characteristics of Spontaneous Square-Wave Jerks in the Healthy Macaque Monkey during Visual Fixation.,"Saccadic intrusions (SIs), predominantly horizontal saccades that interrupt accurate fixation, include square-wave jerks (SWJs; the most common type of SI), which consist of an initial saccade away from the fixation target followed, after a short delay, by a return saccade that brings the eye back onto target. SWJs are present in most human subjects, but are prominent by their increased frequency and size in certain parkinsonian disorders and in recessive, hereditary spinocerebellar ataxias. SWJs have been also documented in monkeys with tectal and cerebellar etiologies, but no studies to date have investigated the occurrence of SWJs in healthy nonhuman primates. Here we set out to determine the characteristics of SWJs in healthy rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) during attempted fixation of a small visual target. Our results indicate that SWJs are common in healthy nonhuman primates. We moreover found primate SWJs to share many characteristics with human SWJs, including the relationship between the size of a saccade and its likelihood to be part of a SWJ. One main discrepancy between monkey and human SWJs was that monkey SWJs tended to be more vertical than horizontal, whereas human SWJs have a strong horizontal preference. Yet, our combined data indicate that primate and human SWJs play a similar role in fixation correction, suggesting that they share a comparable coupling mechanism at the oculomotor generation level. These findings constrain the potential brain areas and mechanisms underlying the generation of fixational saccades in human and nonhuman primates.","Costela, Francisco M (https://www.notion.so/Costela-Francisco-M-333d3e8a16544a169f1bd5c6826b7534?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), McCamy, Michael B (https://www.notion.so/McCamy-Michael-B-34d643bcb56144cc85e9cb3165ba1192?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), Di Stasi, Leandro L (https://www.notion.so/Di-Stasi-Leandro-L-fb897f8222fc4f3a821781f1682fb6a3?pvs=21), Rieiro, Hector (https://www.notion.so/Rieiro-Hector-e89e6af39ca04eb8b787d075dc50553e?pvs=21), Leigh, R John (https://www.notion.so/Leigh-R-John-2e3b39c6e4874202b9a333d0a549efca?pvs=21), Troncoso, Xoana G (https://www.notion.so/Troncoso-Xoana-G-86bb7654556e4d7984201d435d2de17f?pvs=21), Najafian Jazi, Ali (https://www.notion.so/Najafian-Jazi-Ali-af326be6b8584a16887d8b0991c85727?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","Costela, Otero-Millan, McCamy, Macknik, Di Stasi, Rieiro, Leigh, Troncoso, Najafian Jazi, Martinez-Conde",Ocular motor control,"PLoS One. 2015 Jun 11;10(6):e0126485.

Simultaneous recordings of human microsaccades and drifts with a contemporary video eye tracker and the search coil technique.,"Human eyes move continuously, even during visual fixation. These “fixational eye movements” (FEMs) include microsaccades, intersaccadic drift and oculomotor tremor. Research in human FEMs has grown considerably in the last decade, facilitated by the manufacture of noninvasive, high-resolution/speed video-oculography eye trackers. Due to the small magnitude of FEMs, obtaining reliable data can be challenging, however, and depends critically on the sensitivity and precision of the eye tracking system. Yet, no study has conducted an in-depth comparison of human FEM recordings obtained with the search coil (considered the gold standard for measuring microsaccades and drift) and with contemporary, state-of-the art video trackers. Here we measured human microsaccades and drift simultaneously with the search coil and a popular state-of-the-art video tracker. We found that 95% of microsaccades detected with the search coil were also detected with the video tracker, and 95% of microsaccades detected with video tracking were also detected with the search coil, indicating substantial agreement between the two systems. Peak/mean velocities and main sequence slopes of microsaccades detected with video tracking were significantly higher than those of the same microsaccades detected with the search coil, however. Ocular drift was significantly correlated between the two systems, but drift speeds were higher with video tracking than with the search coil. Overall, our combined results suggest that contemporary video tracking now approaches the search coil for measuring FEMs.","McCamy, Michael B (https://www.notion.so/McCamy-Michael-B-34d643bcb56144cc85e9cb3165ba1192?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Leigh, R John (https://www.notion.so/Leigh-R-John-2e3b39c6e4874202b9a333d0a549efca?pvs=21), King, Susan A (https://www.notion.so/King-Susan-A-4d88e8541ddb46d7b08bdca343bc8401?pvs=21), Schneider, Roslyn M (https://www.notion.so/Schneider-Roslyn-M-aaacbd28e1ac4b159ea726bd7684d8f1?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","McCamy, Otero-Millan, Leigh, King, Schneider, Macknik, Martinez-Conde",Measuring eye movements,"PLoS One. 2015 Jun 2;10(6):e0128428.

"Microsaccades and blinks trigger illusory rotation in the ""rotating snakes"" illusion.","Certain repetitive arrangements of luminance gradients elicit the perception of strong illusory motion. Among them, the “Rotating Snakes Illusion” has generated a large amount of interest in the visual neurosciences, as well as in the public. Prior evidence indicates that the Rotating Snakes illusion depends critically on eye movements, yet the specific eye movement types involved and their associated neural mechanisms remain controversial. According to recent reports, slow ocular drift—a nonsaccadic type of fixational eye movement—drives the illusion, whereas microsaccades produced during attempted fixation fail to do so. Here, we asked human subjects to indicate the presence or absence of rotation during the observation of the illusion while we simultaneously recorded their eye movements with high precision. We found a strong quantitative link between microsaccade and blink production and illusory rotation. These results suggest that transient oculomotor events such as microsaccades, saccades, and blinks, rather than continuous drift, act to trigger the illusory motion in the Rotating Snakes illusion.","Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","Otero-Millan, Macknik, Martinez-Conde","Ocular motor control, Vision while moving","J Neurosci. 2012 Apr 25;32(17):6043-51.

Simultaneous recordings of ocular microtremor and microsaccades with a piezoelectric sensor and a video-oculography system.,"Our eyes are in continuous motion. Even when we attempt to fix our gaze, we produce so called “fixational eye movements”, which include microsaccades, drift, and ocular microtremor (OMT). Microsaccades, the largest and fastest type of fixational eye movement, shift the retinal image from several dozen to several hundred photoreceptors and have equivalent physical characteristics to saccades, only on a smaller scale (Martinez-Conde, Otero-Millan & Macknik, 2013). OMT occurs simultaneously with drift and is the smallest of the fixational eye movements (about 1 photoreceptor width, >0.5 arcmin), with dominant frequencies ranging from 70 Hz to 103 Hz (Martinez-Conde, Macknik & Hubel, 2004). Due to OMT’s small amplitude and high frequency, the most accurate and stringent way to record it is the piezoelectric transduction method. Thus, OMT studies are far rarer than those focusing on microsaccades or drift. Here we conducted simultaneous recordings of OMT and microsaccades with a piezoelectric device and a commercial infrared video tracking system. We set out to determine whether OMT could help to restore perceptually faded targets during attempted fixation, and we also wondered whether the piezoelectric sensor could affect the characteristics of microsaccades. Our results showed that microsaccades, but not OMT, counteracted perceptual fading. We moreover found that the piezoelectric sensor affected microsaccades in a complex way, and that the oculomotor system adjusted to the stress brought on by the sensor by adjusting the magnitudes of microsaccades.","McCamy, Michael B (https://www.notion.so/McCamy-Michael-B-34d643bcb56144cc85e9cb3165ba1192?pvs=21), Collins, N (https://www.notion.so/Collins-N-d4e3a7cc5e15431e8a1ca29bd151141a?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Al-Kalbani, M (https://www.notion.so/Al-Kalbani-M-fa4b6e650b2d458ebdeb6bc11ca83be1?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), Coakley, D (https://www.notion.so/Coakley-D-cbaab3a0e79e430b81c1a0ac45baabbc?pvs=21), Troncoso, Xoana G (https://www.notion.so/Troncoso-Xoana-G-86bb7654556e4d7984201d435d2de17f?pvs=21), Boyle, G (https://www.notion.so/Boyle-G-1e3e76a9d1e64deba8486c4b0ddb4409?pvs=21), Narayanan (https://www.notion.so/Narayanan-132eeabbabf64a1a881b70e721d9e63e?pvs=21), Wolf, TR (https://www.notion.so/Wolf-TR-696492e49ce04b4b97445bb86becf350?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","McCamy, Collins, Otero-Millan, Al-Kalbani, Macknik, Coakley, Troncoso, Boyle, Narayanan, Wolf, Martinez-Conde",Measuring eye movements,"PeerJ. 2013 Feb 12;1:e14.

Microsaccades drive illusory motion in the Enigma illusion.,"Visual images consisting of repetitive patterns can elicit striking illusory motion percepts. For almost 200 years, artists, psychologists, and neuroscientists have debated whether this type of illusion originates in the eye or in the brain. For more than a decade, the controversy has centered on the powerful illusory motion perceived in the painting , created by op-artist Isia Leviant. However, no previous study has directly correlated the illusion to any specific physiological mechanism, and so the debate rages on. Here, we show that microsaccades, a type of miniature eye movement produced during visual fixation, can drive illusory motion in . We asked subjects to indicate when illusory motion sped up or slowed down during the observation of while we simultaneously recorded their eye movements with high precision. Before “faster” motion periods, the rate of microsaccades increased. Before “slower/no” motion periods, the rate of microsaccades decreased. These results reveal a direct link between microsaccade production and the perception of illusory motion in and rule out the hypothesis that the origin of the illusion is purely cortical.","Troncoso, Xoana G (https://www.notion.so/Troncoso-Xoana-G-86bb7654556e4d7984201d435d2de17f?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","Troncoso, Macknik, Otero-Millan, Martinez-Conde","Ocular motor control, Vision while moving","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Oct 14;105(41):16033-8.

The effects of fixation target size and luminance on microsaccades and square-wave jerks.,"A large amount of classic and contemporary vision studies require subjects to fixate a target. Target fixation serves as a normalizing factor across studies, promoting the field’s ability to compare and contrast experiments. Yet, fixation target parameters, including luminance, contrast, size, shape and color, vary across studies, potentially affecting the interpretation of results. Previous research on the effects of fixation target size and luminance on the control of fixation position rendered conflicting results, and no study has examined the effects of fixation target characteristics on square-wave jerks, the most common type of saccadic intrusion. Here we set out to determine the effects of fixation target size and luminance on the characteristics of microsaccades and square-wave jerks, over a large range of stimulus parameters. Human subjects fixated a circular target with varying luminance and size while we recorded their eye movements with an infrared video tracker (EyeLink 1000, SR Research). We detected microsaccades and SWJs automatically with objective algorithms developed previously. Microsaccade rates decreased linearly and microsaccade magnitudes increased linearly with target size. The percent of microsaccades forming part of SWJs decreased, and the time from the end of the initial SWJ saccade to the beginning of the second SWJ saccade (SWJ inter-saccadic interval; ISI) increased with target size. The microsaccadic preference for horizontal direction also decreased moderately with target size . Target luminance did not affect significantly microsaccades or SWJs, however. In the absence of a fixation target, microsaccades became scarcer and larger, while SWJ prevalence decreased and SWJ ISIs increased. Thus, the choice of fixation target can affect experimental outcomes, especially in human factors and in visual and oculomotor studies. These results have implications for previous and future research conducted under fixation conditions, and should encourage forthcoming studies to report the size of fixation targets to aid the interpretation and replication of their results.","Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), Langston, Rachel E (https://www.notion.so/Langston-Rachel-E-98db28fde59a419dafac61f81ae3eb20?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","Otero-Millan, Macknik, Langston, Martinez-Conde",Ocular motor control,"PeerJ. 2013 Feb 12;1:e9.

Fixational eye movements and binocular vision.,"During attempted visual fixation, small involuntary eye movements–called fixational eye movements–continuously change of our gaze’s position. Disagreement between the left and right eye positions during such motions can produce diplopia (double vision). Thus, the ability to properly coordinate the two eyes during gaze fixation is critical for stable perception. For the last 50 years, researchers have studied the binocular characteristics of fixational eye movements. Here we review classical and recent studies on the binocular coordination (i.e., degree of conjugacy) of each fixational eye movement type: microsaccades, drift and tremor, and its perceptual contribution to increasing or reducing binocular disparity. We also discuss how amblyopia and other visual pathologies affect the binocular coordination of fixational eye movements.","Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","Otero-Millan, Macknik, Martinez-Conde",Ocular motor control,"Front Integr Neurosci. 2014 Jul 7;8:52.

A decade of magnetic vestibular stimulation: from serendipity to physics to the clinic.,"For many years, people working near strong static magnetic fields of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines have reported dizziness and sensations of vertigo. The discovery a decade ago that a sustained nystagmus can be observed in all humans with an intact labyrinth inside MRI machines led to a possible mechanism: a Lorentz force occurring in the labyrinth from the interactions of normal inner ear ionic currents and the strong static magnetic fields of the MRI machine. Inside an MRI, the Lorentz force acts to induce a constant deflection of the semicircular canal cupula of the superior and lateral semicircular canals. This inner ear stimulation creates a sensation of rotation, and a constant horizontal/torsional nystagmus that can only be observed when visual fixation is removed. Over time, the brain adapts to both the perception of rotation and the nystagmus, with the perception usually diminishing over a few minutes, and the nystagmus persisting at a reduced level for hours. This observation has led to discoveries about how the central vestibular mechanisms adapt to a constant vestibular asymmetry and is a useful model of set-point adaptation or how homeostasis is maintained in response to changes in the internal milieu or the external environment. We review what is known about the effects of stimulation of the vestibular system with high strength-magnetic fields and how the mechanism has been refined since it was first proposed. We suggest future ways that MVS might be used to understand vestibular disease and how it might be treated.","Ward, Bryan K (https://www.notion.so/Ward-Bryan-K-4f440f4f82b64b5faf9300fa9ab9bae5?pvs=21), Roberts, Dale C (https://www.notion.so/Roberts-Dale-C-1095dbbb31614cf49f3a8924321165b6?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Zee, David S (https://www.notion.so/Zee-David-S-a54d8115dd39404fa3fbe60216ee1f7c?pvs=21)","Ward, Roberts, Otero-Millan, Zee",Ocular motor control,"J Neurophysiol. 2019 Jun 1;121(6):2013-2019.

Fixation instability in amblyopia: Oculomotor disease biomarkers predictive of treatment effectiveness.,"Amblyopic patients are known to have fixation instability, particularly of the amblyopic eye. The stability of the fixation is affected by the presence of nystagmus, the frequency and amplitude of fixational saccades and inter-saccadic drifts. Amblyopic patients without nystagmus have increased amplitude of the fixational saccades with reduced frequency of the physiologic microsaccades and have increased inter-saccadic drifts. Amblyopia patients who have experienced a disruption in binocularity in early infancy develop fusion maldevelopment nystagmus (FMN) previously called latent nystagmus as it is more evident during monocular viewing conditions. We have found that some amblyopic patients can have nystagmus with slow phases that are not directed nasally and without the reversal in direction on ocular occlusion, features seen in patients with FMN. The current mainstay of amblyopia treatment comprises of part-time occlusion therapy of the non-amblyopic eye. The amount of patching treatment is in the range of 2-6h/day as determined by the severity of amblyopia. Despite treatment, up to 40% of patients have residual amblyopia. We analyzed the effectiveness of part-time occlusion therapy in amblyopic patients as a function of fixation instability. We categorized amblyopic patients based on their eye movement waveforms obtained during a visual fixation task into those lacking nystagmus, those with FMN and those with nystagmus but no FMN. We did a retrospective chart review to gather information about their clinical characteristics and treatment response. We found that patients with FMN require a more prolonged duration of treatment and have a poorer recovery of stereopsis compared to patients with nystagmus but no FMN and patients lacking nystagmus. This study suggests that eye movement assessment provides valuable information in the management of amblyopia.","Scaramuzzi, Matteo (https://www.notion.so/Scaramuzzi-Matteo-0e6223b4ddfe4128a789cc4b58af0b3b?pvs=21), Murray, Jordan (https://www.notion.so/Murray-Jordan-8bf59185da5c4094bcd6da6bb539f926?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Nucci, Paolo (https://www.notion.so/Nucci-Paolo-c58246cd73594902aef5c565ef6db2fe?pvs=21), Shaikh, Aasef G (https://www.notion.so/Shaikh-Aasef-G-222ee231c59347b595169eb1d634a819?pvs=21), Ghasia, Fatema F (https://www.notion.so/Ghasia-Fatema-F-204d9ba792184b0e9dca1f0739831162?pvs=21)","Scaramuzzi, Murray, Otero-Millan, Nucci, Shaikh, Ghasia",Diagnosis,"Prog Brain Res. 2019;249:235-248.

The disturbance of gaze in progressive supranuclear palsy: implications for pathogenesis.,"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a disease of later life that is currently regarded as a form of neurodegenerative tauopathy. Disturbance of gaze is a cardinal clinical feature of PSP that often helps clinicians to establish the diagnosis. Since the neurobiology of gaze control is now well understood, it is possible to use eye movements as investigational tools to understand aspects of the pathogenesis of PSP. In this review, we summarize each disorder of gaze control that occurs in PSP, drawing on our studies of 50 patients, and on reports from other laboratories that have measured the disturbances of eye movements. When these gaze disorders are approached by considering each functional class of eye movements and its neurobiological basis, a distinct pattern of eye movement deficits emerges that provides insight into the pathogenesis of PSP. Although some aspects of all forms of eye movements are affected in PSP, the predominant defects concern vertical saccades (slow and hypometric, both up and down), impaired vergence, and inability to modulate the linear vestibulo-ocular reflex appropriately for viewing distance. These vertical and vergence eye movements habitually work in concert to enable visuomotor skills that are important during locomotion with the hands free. Taken with the prominent early feature of falls, these findings suggest that PSP tauopathy impairs a recently evolved neural system concerned with bipedal locomotion in an erect posture and frequent gaze shifts between the distant environment and proximate hands. This approach provides a conceptual framework that can be used to address the nosological challenge posed by overlapping clinical and neuropathological features of neurodegenerative tauopathies.","Chen, Athena L (https://www.notion.so/Chen-Athena-L-9d989a6073bb4c79a960ea1e058503d6?pvs=21), Riley, DE (https://www.notion.so/Riley-DE-dd8927626ec7452ba19bfa90b4c41fca?pvs=21), King, Susan A (https://www.notion.so/King-Susan-A-4d88e8541ddb46d7b08bdca343bc8401?pvs=21), Joshi, AC (https://www.notion.so/Joshi-AC-74c37a16a68448e98ee804cfcb0b37da?pvs=21), Serra, Alessandro (https://www.notion.so/Serra-Alessandro-411c7502967e40ef84d37a5cca8d7ef7?pvs=21), Liao, K (https://www.notion.so/Liao-K-8a4eca013391406a90526d4cad31e3a6?pvs=21), Cohen, ML (https://www.notion.so/Cohen-ML-f4d69d8f61d54ebeb97dab180ae4ffd8?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21), Strupp, Michael (https://www.notion.so/Strupp-Michael-e38e6dfd8fc344f980da0296f86ad8f8?pvs=21), Leigh, R John (https://www.notion.so/Leigh-R-John-2e3b39c6e4874202b9a333d0a549efca?pvs=21)","Chen, Riley, King, Joshi, Serra, Liao, Cohen, Otero-Millan, Martinez-Conde, Strupp, Leigh",Diagnosis,"Front Neurol. 2010 Dec 3;1:147.

Abnormal Fixational Eye Movements in Amblyopia.,"Purpose Fixational saccades shift the foveal image to counteract visual fading related to neural adaptation. Drifts are slow eye movements between two adjacent fixational saccades. We quantified fixational saccades and asked whether their changes could be attributed to pathologic drifts seen in amblyopia, one of the most common causes of blindness in childhood. Methods Thirty-six pediatric subjects with varying severity of amblyopia and eleven healthy age-matched controls held their gaze on a visual target. Eye movements were measured with high-resolution video-oculography during fellow eye-viewing and amblyopic eye-viewing conditions. Fixational saccades and drifts were analyzed in the amblyopic and fellow eye and compared with controls. Results We found an increase in the amplitude with decreased frequency of fixational saccades in children with amblyopia. These alterations in fixational eye movements correlated with the severity of their amblyopia. There was also an increase in eye position variance during drifts in amblyopes. There was no correlation between the eye position variance or the eye velocity during ocular drifts and the amplitude of subsequent fixational saccade. Our findings suggest that abnormalities in fixational saccades in amblyopia are independent of the ocular drift. Discussion This investigation of amblyopia in pediatric age group quantitatively characterizes the fixation instability. Impaired properties of fixational saccades could be the consequence of abnormal processing and reorganization of the visual system in amblyopia. Paucity in the visual feedback during amblyopic eye-viewing condition can attribute to the increased eye position variance and drift velocity.","Shaikh, Aasef G (https://www.notion.so/Shaikh-Aasef-G-222ee231c59347b595169eb1d634a819?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Kumar, Priyanka (https://www.notion.so/Kumar-Priyanka-c22265eefbc34448b26451df0c45cbc2?pvs=21), Ghasia, Fatema F (https://www.notion.so/Ghasia-Fatema-F-204d9ba792184b0e9dca1f0739831162?pvs=21)","Shaikh, Otero-Millan, Kumar, Ghasia",Diagnosis,"PLoS One. 2016 Mar 1;11(3):e0149953.

"Rebound nystagmus, a window into the oculomotor integrator.","Rebound nystagmus, a common cerebellar sign, is a transient nystagmus that appears on returning to straight-ahead gaze after prolonged eccentric gaze. The slow phases of rebound nystagmus are in the direction of prior eccentric gaze. After eccentric gaze, healthy subjects also show rebound nystagmus when fixation is removed. Rebound nystagmus is thought to be related to the function of the oculomotor neural integrator—the circuit that ensures accurate gaze holding after any eye movement—but the exact mechanism of rebound nystagmus is unknown. Here, we combine experimental data with mathematical modeling to test several hypotheses for the generation of rebound nystagmus. We show that two mechanisms contribute, one relies on vision and the other does not. Future experiments must determine if (1) the non-visual mechanism is related to eye position or to eye velocity signals and (2) whether these signals are based on afferent (proprioception) or efferent (corollary) information.","Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Colpak, Ayse Ilksen (https://www.notion.so/Colpak-Ayse-Ilksen-c73c9fd7a8024a769f9ba73225ff7d34?pvs=21), Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21), Zee, David S (https://www.notion.so/Zee-David-S-a54d8115dd39404fa3fbe60216ee1f7c?pvs=21)","Otero-Millan, Colpak, Kheradmand, Zee",Ocular motor control,"Prog Brain Res. 2019;249:197-209.

Social misdirection fails to enhance a magic illusion.,"Visual, multisensory and cognitive illusions in magic performances provide new windows into the psychological and neural principles of perception, attention and cognition. We investigated a magic effect consisting of a coin “vanish” (i.e. the perceptual disappearance of a coin after a simulated toss from hand to hand). Previous research has shown that magicians can use joint attention cues such as their own gaze direction to strengthen the observers’ perception of magic. Here we presented naïve observers with videos including real and simulated coin tosses to determine if joint attention might enhance the illusory perception of simulated coin tosses. The observers’ eye positions were measured, and their perceptual responses simultaneously recorded via button press. To control for the magician’s use of joint attention cues, we occluded his head in half of the trials. We found that subjects did not direct their gaze at the magician’s face at the time of the coin toss, whether the face was visible or occluded, and that the presence of the magician’s face did not enhance the illusion. Thus, our results show that joint attention is not necessary for the perception of this effect. We conclude that social misdirection is redundant and possibly detracting to this very robust sleight-of-hand illusion. We further determined that subjects required multiple trials to effectively distinguish real from simulated tosses; thus the illusion was resilient to repeated viewing.","Cui, Jie (https://www.notion.so/Cui-Jie-8efdedde7ab5488182f30051107b4ea1?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), King, Mac (https://www.notion.so/King-Mac-b7b68827ce0242578cace4e752069045?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","Cui, Otero-Millan, Macknik, King, Martinez-Conde",,"Front Hum Neurosci. 2011 Sep 29;5:103.

An oculomotor continuum from exploration to fixation.,"During visual exploration, saccadic eye movements scan the scene for objects of interest. During attempted fixation, the eyes are relatively still but often produce microsaccades. Saccadic rates during exploration are higher than those of microsaccades during fixation, reinforcing the classic view that exploration and fixation are two distinct oculomotor behaviors. An alternative model is that fixation and exploration are not dichotomous, but are instead two extremes of a functional continuum. Here, we measured the eye movements of human observers as they either fixed their gaze on a small spot or scanned natural scenes of varying sizes. As scene size diminished, so did saccade rates, until they were continuous with microsaccadic rates during fixation. Other saccadic properties varied as function of image size as well, forming a continuum with microsaccadic parameters during fixation. This saccadic continuum extended to nonrestrictive, ecological viewing conditions that allowed all types of saccades and fixation positions. Eye movement simulations moreover showed that a single model of oculomotor behavior can explain the saccadic continuum from exploration to fixation, for images of all sizes. These findings challenge the view that exploration and fixation are dichotomous, suggesting instead that visual fixation is functionally equivalent to visual exploration on a spatially focused scale.","Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), Langston, Rachel E (https://www.notion.so/Langston-Rachel-E-98db28fde59a419dafac61f81ae3eb20?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","Otero-Millan, Macknik, Langston, Martinez-Conde",Ocular motor control,"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Apr 9;110(15):6175-80.

Exploring the Role of Temporoparietal Cortex in Upright Perception and the Link With Torsional Eye Position.,"Upright perception is a key aspect of orientation constancy, as we maintain a stable perception of the world despite continuous movements of our eyes, head and body. Torsional position of the eyes can impact perception of upright by changing orientation of the images on the retina relative to gravity. Here we investigated the role of temporo-parietal cortex in upright perception with respect to ocular torsion, by means of the inhibitory effect of continuous theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We used a subjective visual vertical (SVV) paradigm to track changes in upright perception, and a custom video method to track ocular torsion simultaneously. Twelve participants were tested during lateral head tilt of 20o to the left. TMS at the posterior aspect of the supramarginal gyrus (SMGp) resulted in an average SVV shift in the opposite direction of the head tilt compared to sham stimulations (1.8o). Ocular torsion following TMS at SMGp showed no significant change compared to sham stimulations (-0.1o). Thus, changes in upright perception at SMGp was dissociated from ocular torsion. This finding suggests that perception of upright at SMGp is primarily related to processing sensory inputs, as opposed to subcortical regions that have direct influence over ocular torsion.","Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Winnick, Ariel (https://www.notion.so/Winnick-Ariel-2a0caa2cf53246008e05ff0e438bf927?pvs=21), Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21)","Otero-Millan, Winnick, Kheradmand",Vision while moving,"Front Neurol. 2018 Apr 6;9:192.

Multiple Time Courses of Vestibular Set-Point Adaptation Revealed by Sustained Magnetic Field Stimulation of the Labyrinth.,"Summary
A major focus in neurobiology is how the brain adapts its motor behavior to changes in its internal and external environments [1, 2]. Much is known about adaptively optimizing the amplitude and direction of eye and limb movements, for example, but little is known about another essential form of learning, “set-point” adaptation. Set-point adaptation balances tonic activity so that reciprocally acting, agonist and antagonist muscles have a stable platform from which to launch accurate movements. Here, we use the vestibulo-ocular reflex—a simple behavior that stabilizes the position of the eye while the head is moving—to investigate how tonic activity is adapted toward a new set point to prevent eye drift when the head is still [3, 4]. Set-point adaptation was elicited with magneto-hydrodynamic vestibular stimulation (MVS) by placing normal humans in a 7T MRI for 90 min. MVS is ideal for prolonged labyrinthine activation because it mimics constant head acceleration and induces a sustained nystagmus similar to natural vestibular lesions [5, 6]. The MVS-induced nystagmus diminished slowly but incompletely over multiple timescales. We propose a new adaptation hypothesis, using a cascade of imperfect mathematical integrators, that reproduces the response to MVS (and more natural chair rotations), including the gradual decrease in nystagmus as the set point changes over progressively longer time courses. MVS set-point adaptation is a biological model with applications to basic neurophysiological research into all types of movements [7], functional brain imaging [8], and treatment of vestibular and higher-level attentional disorders by introducing new biases to counteract pathological ones [9].","Jareonsettasin, Prem (https://www.notion.so/Jareonsettasin-Prem-d43bfa10bbba43b499617087799f7ec3?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Ward, Bryan K (https://www.notion.so/Ward-Bryan-K-4f440f4f82b64b5faf9300fa9ab9bae5?pvs=21), Roberts, Dale C (https://www.notion.so/Roberts-Dale-C-1095dbbb31614cf49f3a8924321165b6?pvs=21), Schubert, Michael (https://www.notion.so/Schubert-Michael-be9dd5934032430296fbd811266b54c6?pvs=21), Zee, David S (https://www.notion.so/Zee-David-S-a54d8115dd39404fa3fbe60216ee1f7c?pvs=21)","Jareonsettasin, Otero-Millan, Ward, Roberts, Schubert, Zee",Ocular motor control,"Curr Biol. 2016 May 23;26(10):1359-66.

"Modeling the Triggering of Saccades, Microsaccades, and Saccadic Intrusions.","When we explore a static visual scene, our eyes move in a sequence of fast eye movements called saccades, which are separated by fixation periods of relative eye stability. Based on uncertain sensory and cognitive inputs, the oculomotor system must decide, at every moment, whether to initiate a saccade or remain in the fixation state. Even when we attempt to maintain our gaze on a small spot, small saccades, called microsaccades, intrude on fixation once or twice per second. Because microsaccades occur at the boundary of the decision to maintain fixation versus starting a saccade, they offer a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms that control saccadic triggering. Abnormal saccadic intrusions can occur during attempted fixation in patients with neurodegenerative disorders. We have implemented a model of the triggering mechanism of saccades, based on known anatomy and physiology, that successfully simulates the generation of saccades of any size—including microsaccades in healthy observers, and the saccadic intrusions that interrupt attempted fixation in parkinsonian patients. The model suggests that noisy neuronal activity in the Superior Colliculus controls the state of a mutually inhibitory network in the brain stem formed by burst neurons and omnipause neurons. When the neuronal activity is centered at the rostral pole the system remains at a state of fixation. When activity is perturbed away from this center, a saccade is triggered. This perturbation can be produced either by the intent to move one’s gaze or by random fluctuations in activity.","Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Lance Optican (https://www.notion.so/Lance-Optican-8907dada30bf4681b9006c7143b64aac?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","Otero-Millan, Lance Optican, Macknik, Martinez-Conde","Diagnosis, Ocular motor control","Front Neurol. 2018 May 28;9:346.

The video ocular counter-roll (vOCR): a clinical test to detect loss of otolith-ocular function.,"Conclusion
vOCR can detect loss of otolith-ocular function without specifying the side of vestibular loss. Since vOCR is measured with a simple head tilt maneuver, it can be potentially used as a bedside clinical test in combination with video head impulse test.
Objective
Video-oculography (VOG) goggles are being integrated into the bedside assessment of patients with vestibular disorders. Lacking, however, is a method to evaluate otolith function. This study validated a VOG test for loss of otolith function.
Methods
VOG was used to measure ocular counter-roll (vOCR) in 12 healthy controls, 14 patients with unilateral vestibular loss (UVL), and six patients with bilateral vestibular loss (BVL) with a static lateral head tilt of 30°. The results were compared with vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP), a widely-used laboratory test of otolith function.
Results
The average vOCR for healthy controls (4.6°) was significantly different from UVL (2.7°) and BVL (1.6°) patients (p < 0.0001). The vOCR and VEMP measurements were correlated across subjects, especially the click and tap oVEMPs (click oVEMP R = 0.45, tap oVEMP R = 0.51; p < 0.0003). The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that vOCR and VEMPs detected loss of otolith function equally well. The best threshold for vOCR to detect vestibular loss was at 3°. The vOCR values from the side of vestibular loss and the healthy side were not different in UVL patients (2.53° vs 2.8°; p = 0.59).","Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Treviño, Carolina (https://www.notion.so/Trevi-o-Carolina-357dc52a0f93497d820a00ea866f7f15?pvs=21), Winnick, Ariel (https://www.notion.so/Winnick-Ariel-2a0caa2cf53246008e05ff0e438bf927?pvs=21), Zee, David S (https://www.notion.so/Zee-David-S-a54d8115dd39404fa3fbe60216ee1f7c?pvs=21), Carey, John P (https://www.notion.so/Carey-John-P-b8532aeefbf046ab89291c9e52330c78?pvs=21), Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21)","Otero-Millan, Treviño, Winnick, Zee, Carey, Kheradmand",Diagnosis,"Acta Otolaryngol. 2017 Jun;137(6):593-597.

Stronger misdirection in curved than in straight motion.,"Illusions developed by magicians are a rich and largely untapped source of insight into perception and cognition. Here we show that curved motion, as employed by the magician in a classic sleight of hand trick, generates stronger misdirection than rectilinear motion, and that this difference can be explained by the differential engagement of the smooth pursuit and the saccadic oculomotor systems.

"Knowing what the brain is seeing in three dimensions: A novel, noninvasive, sensitive, accurate, and low-noise technique for measuring ocular torsion.","Torsional eye movements are rotations of the eye around the line of sight. Measuring torsion is essential to understanding how the brain controls eye position and how it creates a veridical perception of object orientation in three dimensions. Torsion is also important for diagnosis of many vestibular, neurological, and ophthalmological disorders. Currently, there are multiple devices and methods that produce reliable measurements of horizontal and vertical eye movements. Measuring torsion, however, noninvasively and reliably has been a longstanding challenge, with previous methods lacking real-time capabilities or suffering from intrusive artifacts. We propose a novel method for measuring eye movements in three dimensions using modern computer vision software (OpenCV) and concepts of iris recognition. To measure torsion, we use template matching of the entire iris and automatically account for occlusion of the iris and pupil by the eyelids. The current setup operates binocularly at 100 Hz with noise <0.1° and is accurate within 20° of gaze to the left, to the right, and up and 10° of gaze down. This new method can be widely applicable and fill a gap in many scientific and clinical disciplines.","Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Roberts, Dale C (https://www.notion.so/Roberts-Dale-C-1095dbbb31614cf49f3a8924321165b6?pvs=21), Lasker, Adrian (https://www.notion.so/Lasker-Adrian-0c993fd939f449c58ed266d12473dacf?pvs=21), Zee, David S (https://www.notion.so/Zee-David-S-a54d8115dd39404fa3fbe60216ee1f7c?pvs=21), Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21)","Otero-Millan, Roberts, Lasker, Zee, Kheradmand",Measuring eye movements,"J Vis. 2015;15(14):11.

Saccades during attempted fixation in parkinsonian disorders and recessive ataxia: from microsaccades to square-wave jerks.,"During attempted visual fixation, saccades of a range of sizes occur. These ""fixational saccades"" include microsaccades, which are not apparent in regular clinical tests, and ""saccadic intrusions"", predominantly horizontal saccades that interrupt accurate fixation. Square-wave jerks (SWJs), the most common type of saccadic intrusion, consist of an initial saccade away from the target followed, after a short delay, by a ""return saccade"" that brings the eye back onto target. SWJs are present in most human subjects, but are prominent by their increased frequency and size in certain parkinsonian disorders and in recessive, hereditary spinocerebellar ataxias. Here we asked whether fixational saccades showed distinctive features in various parkinsonian disorders and in recessive ataxia. Although some saccadic properties differed between patient groups, in all conditions larger saccades were more likely to form SWJs, and the intervals between the first and second saccade of SWJs were similar. These findings support the proposal of a common oculomotor mechanism that generates all fixational saccades, including microsaccades and SWJs. The same mechanism also explains how the return saccade in SWJs is triggered by the position error that occurs when the first saccadic component is large, both in the healthy brain and in neurological disease.","Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Schneider, Roslyn M (https://www.notion.so/Schneider-Roslyn-M-aaacbd28e1ac4b159ea726bd7684d8f1?pvs=21), Leigh, R John (https://www.notion.so/Leigh-R-John-2e3b39c6e4874202b9a333d0a549efca?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","Otero-Millan, Schneider, Leigh, Macknik, Martinez-Conde",Diagnosis,"PLoS One. 2013;8(3):e58535.

Area V1 responses to illusory corner-folds in Vasarely's nested squares and the Alternating Brightness Star illusions.,"Vasarely’s nested squares illusion shows that the corners of concentric squares, arranged in a gradient of increasing or decreasing luminance, generate illusory “corner-folds,” which appear more salient (either brighter or darker) than the adjacent flat (non- corner) regions of each individual square. The Alternating Brightness Star (ABS) illusion, based on Vasarely’s classic nested squares, further shows that the strength of these corner-folds depends on corner angle. Previous psychophysical studies showed the relationship between corner angle and perceived contrast in the ABS illusion to be linear, with sharp angles looking higher in contrast, and shallow angles lower in contrast. Center-surround difference-of-Gaussians (DOG) modeling did not replicate this linear relationship, however, suggesting that a full neural explanation of the nested squares and ABS illusions might be found in the visual cortex, rather than at subcortical stages. Here we recorded the responses from single area V1 neurons in the awake primate, during the presentation of visual stimuli containing illusory corner-folds of various angles. Our results showed stronger neural responses for illusory corner-folds made from sharper than from shallower corners, consistent with predictions from the previous psychophysical work. The relationship between corner angle and strength of the neuronal responses, albeit parametric, was apparently non-linear. This finding was in line with the previous DOG data, but not with the psychophysical data. Our combined results suggest that, whereas corner-fold illusions likely originate from center-surround retinogeniculate processes, their complete neural explanation may be found in extrastriate visual cortical areas.","Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21), McCamy, Michael B (https://www.notion.so/McCamy-Michael-B-34d643bcb56144cc85e9cb3165ba1192?pvs=21), Troncoso, Xoana G (https://www.notion.so/Troncoso-Xoana-G-86bb7654556e4d7984201d435d2de17f?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21)","Martinez-Conde, McCamy, Troncoso, Otero-Millan, Macknik",Vision while moving,"PLoS One. 2019 Mar 28;14(3):e0210941.

Visual Search in Amblyopia: Abnormal Fixational Eye Movements and Suboptimal Sampling Strategies.,"Purpose: Microsaccades shift the image on the fovea and counteract visual fading. They are also thought to serve as an optimal sampling strategy while viewing complex visual scenes. The goal of our study was to assess visual search in amblyopic children.
Methods: Twenty-one amblyopic children with varying severity of amblyopia and 10 healthy controls were recruited. Eye movements were recorded using infrared video-oculography during amblyopic and fellow eye viewing while the subjects performed (1) visual fixation, (2) exploration of a blank scene, and (3) visual search task (spot the difference between two images). The number of correctly identified picture differences and reaction time were recorded. Microsaccade, saccades, and intersaccadic drifts were analyzed in patients without latent nystagmus (LN). Slow phase velocities were computed for patients with LN.
Results: Both patients with and without LN were able to spot the same number of differences but took longer during fellow eye viewing compared to controls. The ability to identify differences was diminished during amblyopic eye viewing particularly those with LN and severe amblyopia. We found reduced frequencies of microsaccades and saccades in both amblyopic and fellow eyes during fixation and visual search but not during exploration of blank scene. Across all tasks, amblyopes with LN had increased intersaccadic drifts.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that deficient microsaccade and saccadic activity contributes to poorer sampling strategy in amblyopia, which is seen in both amblyopic and fellow eye. These deficits are more notable among subjects who experienced binocular decorrelation earlier in life, with subsequent development of LN.","Chen, Dinah (https://www.notion.so/Chen-Dinah-5b721419c9644016afbc2c8ca9bc160a?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Kumar, Priyanka (https://www.notion.so/Kumar-Priyanka-c22265eefbc34448b26451df0c45cbc2?pvs=21), Shaikh, Aasef G (https://www.notion.so/Shaikh-Aasef-G-222ee231c59347b595169eb1d634a819?pvs=21), Ghasia, Fatema F (https://www.notion.so/Ghasia-Fatema-F-204d9ba792184b0e9dca1f0739831162?pvs=21)","Chen, Otero-Millan, Kumar, Shaikh, Ghasia",Diagnosis,"Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2018 Sep 4;59(11):4506-4517.

Task difficulty in mental arithmetic affects microsaccadic rates and magnitudes.,"Microsaccades are involuntary, small-magnitude saccadic eye movements that occur during attempted visual fixation. Recent research has found that attention can modulate microsaccade dynamics, but few studies have addressed the effects of task difficulty on microsaccade parameters, and those have obtained contradictory results. Further, no study to date has investigated the influence of task difficulty on microsaccade production during the performance of non-visual tasks. Thus, the effects of task difficulty on microsaccades, isolated from sensory modality, remain unclear. Here we investigated the effects of task difficulty on microsaccades during the performance of a non-visual, mental arithmetic task with two levels of complexity. We found that microsaccade rates decreased and microsaccade magnitudes increased with increased task difficulty. We propose that changes in microsaccade rates and magnitudes with task difficulty are mediated by the effects of varying attentional inputs on the rostral superior colliculus activity map.","Siegenthaler, Eva (https://www.notion.so/Siegenthaler-Eva-c9a936aeff7646a1ad3ba480cf1ac49e?pvs=21), Costela, Francisco M (https://www.notion.so/Costela-Francisco-M-333d3e8a16544a169f1bd5c6826b7534?pvs=21), McCamy, Michael B (https://www.notion.so/McCamy-Michael-B-34d643bcb56144cc85e9cb3165ba1192?pvs=21), Di Stasi, Leandro L (https://www.notion.so/Di-Stasi-Leandro-L-fb897f8222fc4f3a821781f1682fb6a3?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Sonderegger, A (https://www.notion.so/Sonderegger-A-ac3dc14c44b142fcafc2d302cbdb0d5f?pvs=21), Groner, Rudolf (https://www.notion.so/Groner-Rudolf-13ee1997179e4ec38e405dd51589b51b?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","Siegenthaler, Costela, McCamy, Di Stasi, Otero-Millan, Sonderegger, Groner, Macknik, Martinez-Conde",Ocular motor control,"Eur J Neurosci. 2014 Jan;39(2):287-94.

BOLD activation varies parametrically with corner angle throughout human retinotopic cortex.,"The Alternating Brightness Star (ABS) is an illusion that provides insight into the relationship between brightness perception and corner angle. Recent psychophysical studies of this illusion have shown that corner salience varies parametrically with corner angle, with sharp angles leading to strong illusory percepts and shallow angles leading to weak percepts. It is hypothesized that the illusory effects arise because of an interaction between surface corners and the shape of visual receptive fields: sharp surface corners may create hotspots of high local contrast due to processing by center-surround and other early receptive fields. If this hypothesis is correct, early visual neurons should respond powerfully to sharp corners and curved portions of surface edges. Indeed, the primary role of early visual neurons may be to localize the discontinuities along the edges of surfaces. If so, all early visual areas should show greater BOLD responses to sharp corners than to shallow corners. On the other hand, if corner processing is exclusively constrained to certain areas of the brain, only those specific areas will show greater responses to sharp vs shallow corners. To address this we explored the BOLD correlates of the ABS illusion in the human visual cortex using fMRI. We found that BOLD signal varies parametrically with corner angle throughout the visual cortex, offering the first neurophysiological correlates of the ABS illusion. This finding provides a neurophysiological basis for the previously reported psychophysical data that showed that corner salience varied parametrically with corner angle. We propose that all early visual areas localize discontinuities along the edges of surfaces, and that specific cortical corner-processing circuits further establish the specific nature of those discontinuities, such as their orientation.","Troncoso, Xoana G (https://www.notion.so/Troncoso-Xoana-G-86bb7654556e4d7984201d435d2de17f?pvs=21), Tse, Peter U  (https://www.notion.so/Tse-Peter-U-5d0811ec25494ce69e27d7a604da788d?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), Caplovitz, Gideon P (https://www.notion.so/Caplovitz-Gideon-P-17c401ae29234b0db7303ecb73ae9feb?pvs=21), Hsieh, Paul J (https://www.notion.so/Hsieh-Paul-J-5af81bac1b7b4179824b10ff8ae9d1f6?pvs=21), Schlegel, Alex A (https://www.notion.so/Schlegel-Alex-A-d9659dee04424a37ba2d2d8922ddd788?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","Troncoso, Tse, Macknik, Caplovitz, Hsieh, Schlegel, Otero-Millan, Martinez-Conde",,Perception. 2007;36(6):808-20.,"June 29, 2020 1:21 PM",,,,"Troncoso, Xoana G (https://www.notion.so/Troncoso-Xoana-G-86bb7654556e4d7984201d435d2de17f?pvs=21)",,Perception,"April 22, 2021 2:54 PM",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17718360,,,,17718360,,,"June 1, 2007",,"Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)",,Published🎉,,,Research article,2007,
Errors of Upright Perception in Patients With Vestibular Migraine.,"Patients with vestibular migraine (VM) often report dizziness with changes in the head or body position. Such symptoms raise the possibility of dysfunction in neural mechanisms underlying spatial orientation in these patients. Here we addressed this issue by investigating the effect of static head tilts on errors of upright perception in a group of 27 VM patients in comparison with a group of 27 healthy controls. Perception of upright was measured in a dark room using a subjective visual vertical (SVV) paradigm at three head tilt positions (upright, ±20°). VM patients were also surveyed about the quality of their dizziness and spatial symptoms during daily activities. In the upright head position, SVV errors were within the normal range for VM patients and healthy controls (within 2° from true vertical). During the static head tilts of 20° to the right, VM patients showed larger SVV errors consistent with overestimation of the tilt magnitude (i.e., as if they felt further tilted toward the right side) (VM: -3.21° ± 0.93 vs. Control: 0.52° ± 0.70; p = 0.002). During the head tilt to the left, SVV errors in VM patients did not differ significantly from controls (VM: 0.77° ± 1.05 vs. Control: -0.04° ± 0.68; p = 0.52). There was no significant difference in SVV precision between the VM patients and healthy controls at any head tilt position. Consistent with the direction of the SVV errors in VM patients, they largely reported spatial symptoms toward the right side. These findings suggest an abnormal sensory integration for spatial orientation in vestibular migraine, related to daily dizziness in these patients.","Winnick, Ariel (https://www.notion.so/Winnick-Ariel-2a0caa2cf53246008e05ff0e438bf927?pvs=21), Sadeghpour, Shirin (https://www.notion.so/Sadeghpour-Shirin-bc5c3d114f03477fab01d009fe76dbfb?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Chang, Tzu Pu (https://www.notion.so/Chang-Tzu-Pu-42eea05a5f994ef7889ff462bcd175b5?pvs=21), Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21)","Winnick, Sadeghpour, Otero-Millan, Chang, Kheradmand","Diagnosis, Vision while moving","Front Neurol. 2018 Oct 30;9:892.

V1 neurons respond differently to object motion versus motion from eye movements.,"How does the visual system differentiate self-generated motion from motion in the external world? Humans can discern object motion from identical retinal image displacements induced by eye movements, but the brain mechanisms underlying this ability are unknown. Here we exploit the frequent production of microsaccades during ocular fixation in the primate to compare primary visual cortical responses to self-generated motion (real microsaccades) versus motion in the external world (object motion mimicking microsaccades). Real and simulated microsaccades were randomly interleaved in the same viewing condition, thereby producing equivalent oculomotor and behavioural engagement. Our results show that real microsaccades generate biphasic neural responses, consisting of a rapid increase in the firing rate followed by a slow and smaller-amplitude suppression that drops below baseline. Simulated microsaccades generate solely excitatory responses. These findings indicate that V1 neurons can respond differently to internally and externally generated motion, and expand V1’s potential role in information processing and visual stability during eye movements.

Changes in visibility as a function of spatial frequency and microsaccade occurrence.,"Fixational eye movements (FEMs), including microsaccades, drift, and tremor, shift our eye position during ocular fixation, producing retinal motion that is thought to help visibility by counteracting neural adaptation to unchanging stimulation. Yet, how each FEM type influences this process is still debated. Recent studies found little to no relationship between microsaccades and visual perception of spatial frequencies (SF). However, these conclusions were based on coarse analyses that make it hard to appreciate the actual effects of microsaccades on target visibility as a function of SF. Thus, how microsaccades contribute to the visibility of stimuli of different SFs remains unclear. Here, we asked how the visibility of targets of various SFs changed over time, in relationship with concurrent microsaccade production. Participants continuously reported on changes in target visibility, allowing us to time-lock ongoing changes in microsaccade parameters to perceptual transitions in visibility. Microsaccades restored/increased the visibility of low SF targets more efficiently than that of high SF targets. Yet, microsaccade rates rose before periods of increased visibility, and dropped before periods of diminished visibility, for all the SFs tested, suggesting that microsaccades boosted target visibility across a wide range of SFs. Our data also indicate that visual stimuli fade/become harder to see less often in the presence of microsaccades. In addition, larger microsaccades restored/increased target visibility more effectively than smaller microsaccades. These combined results support the proposal that microsaccades enhance visibility across a broad variety of SFs.","Costela, Francisco M (https://www.notion.so/Costela-Francisco-M-333d3e8a16544a169f1bd5c6826b7534?pvs=21), McCamy, Michael B (https://www.notion.so/McCamy-Michael-B-34d643bcb56144cc85e9cb3165ba1192?pvs=21), Coffelt, Mary (https://www.notion.so/Coffelt-Mary-07376cd00c444ba7adb86bd8a9905162?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","Costela, McCamy, Coffelt, Otero-Millan, Macknik, Martinez-Conde","Ocular motor control, Vision while moving","Eur J Neurosci. 2017 Feb;45(3):433-439.

Fixational eye movement correction of blink-induced gaze position errors.,"Our eyes move continuously. Even when we attempt to fix our gaze, we produce “fixational” eye movements including microsaccades, drift and tremor. The potential role of microsaccades versus drifts in the control of eye position has been debated for decades and remains in question today. Here we set out to determine the corrective functions of microsaccades and drifts on gaze-position errors due to blinks in non-human primates (Macaca mulatta) and humans. Our results show that blinks contribute to the instability of gaze during fixation, and that microsaccades, but not drifts, correct fixation errors introduced by blinks. These findings provide new insights about eye position control during fixation, and indicate a more general role of microsaccades in fixation correction than thought previously.","Costela, Francisco M (https://www.notion.so/Costela-Francisco-M-333d3e8a16544a169f1bd5c6826b7534?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), McCamy, Michael B (https://www.notion.so/McCamy-Michael-B-34d643bcb56144cc85e9cb3165ba1192?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), Troncoso, Xoana G (https://www.notion.so/Troncoso-Xoana-G-86bb7654556e4d7984201d435d2de17f?pvs=21), Najafian Jazi, Ali (https://www.notion.so/Najafian-Jazi-Ali-af326be6b8584a16887d8b0991c85727?pvs=21), Crook, SM (https://www.notion.so/Crook-SM-acb73ecfa7024c49bca1a5c7b436ffeb?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","Costela, Otero-Millan, McCamy, Macknik, Troncoso, Najafian Jazi, Crook, Martinez-Conde",Ocular motor control,"PLoS One. 2014 Oct 21;9(10):e110889.

Microsaccadic efficacy and contribution to foveal and peripheral vision.,"Our eyes move constantly, even when we try to fixate our gaze. Fixational eye movements prevent and restore visual loss during fixation, yet the relative impact of each type of fixational eye movement remains controversial. For over five decades, the debate has focused on microsaccades, the fastest and largest fixational eye movements. Some recent studies have concluded that microsaccades counteract visual fading during fixation. Other studies have disputed this idea, contending that microsaccades play no significant role in vision. The disagreement stems from the lack of methods to determine the precise effects of microsaccades on vision versus those of other eye movements, as well as a lack of evidence that microsaccades are relevant to foveal vision. Here we developed a novel generalized method to determine the precise quantified contribution and efficacy of human microsaccades to restoring visibility compared with other eye movements. Our results indicate that microsaccades are the greatest eye movement contributor to the restoration of both foveal and peripheral vision during fixation. Our method to calculate the efficacy and contribution of microsaccades to perception can determine the strength of connection between any two physiological and/or perceptual events, providing a novel and powerful estimate of causal influence; thus, we anticipate wide-ranging applications in neuroscience and beyond.","McCamy, Michael B (https://www.notion.so/McCamy-Michael-B-34d643bcb56144cc85e9cb3165ba1192?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), Yang, Y (https://www.notion.so/Yang-Y-607c7308134d422db192845442f70069?pvs=21), Troncoso, Xoana G (https://www.notion.so/Troncoso-Xoana-G-86bb7654556e4d7984201d435d2de17f?pvs=21), Baer, SM (https://www.notion.so/Baer-SM-63874c1abbc64954943b737c5a5b0ef5?pvs=21), Crook, SM (https://www.notion.so/Crook-SM-acb73ecfa7024c49bca1a5c7b436ffeb?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","McCamy, Otero-Millan, Macknik, Yang, Troncoso, Baer, Crook, Martinez-Conde","Ocular motor control, Vision while moving","J Neurosci. 2012 Jul 4;32(27):9194-204.

No handedness effect on spatial orientation or ocular counter-roll during lateral head tilts.,"Although vestibular inputs are bilaterally represented within the cerebral hemispheres, the higher level vestibular functions exhibit hemispheric asymmetries. Previous studies have suggested that such asymmetries are associated with handedness. Here, we studied the impact of handedness (i.e., hemispheric lateralization) on spatial orientation using a subjective visual vertical (SVV) task. We tested 22 right‐handed and 22 left‐handed subjects in upright position, during prolonged lateral head tilts of 20° (~15 min), and after the head returned to upright position. The corresponding changes in torsional eye position were measured simultaneously using video‐oculography. During lateral head tilts, both right‐ and left‐handers had initial SVV biases in the opposite direction of the head tilt (right‐handers: left tilt 3.0 ± 1.3°, right tilt −4.7 ± 1.5°; left‐handers: left tilt 3.4 ± 1.1°, right tilt −4.1 ± 1.0°). The SVV subsequently drifted in the direction of the head tilt, and there was an aftereffect in the same direction when the head was brought back upright. The ocular torsion initially changed in the opposite direction of the head tilt (right‐handers: left tilt 3.8 ± 0.4°, right tilt −3.8 ± 0.4°; left‐handers: left tilt 4.2 ± 0.5°, right tilt −4.5 ± 0.5°), and there were also drift and aftereffect in the same direction as the head tilt. The changes in upright perception and ocular torsion did not differ between right‐ and left‐handers. These findings show no functional laterality, neither in the higher level neural mechanisms that maintain spatial orientation, nor in the lower level mechanisms that generate the ocular torsion response during lateral head tilt.","Winnick, Ariel (https://www.notion.so/Winnick-Ariel-2a0caa2cf53246008e05ff0e438bf927?pvs=21), Sadeghpour, Shirin (https://www.notion.so/Sadeghpour-Shirin-bc5c3d114f03477fab01d009fe76dbfb?pvs=21), Sova, Michael (https://www.notion.so/Sova-Michael-947df1453530439aa34a483ea76388ad?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21)","Winnick, Sadeghpour, Sova, Otero-Millan, Kheradmand",Vision while moving,"Physiol Rep. 2019 Aug;7(13):e14160.

Abnormal fixational eye movements in strabismus.,"Introduction Fixational saccades are miniature eye movements that constantly change the gaze during attempted visual fixation. Visually guided saccades and fixational saccades represent an oculomotor continuum and are produced by common neural machinery. Patients with strabismus have disconjugate binocular horizontal saccades. We examined the stability and variability of eye position during fixation in patients with strabismus and correlated the severity of fixational instability with strabismus angle and binocular vision.
Methods Eye movements were measured in 13 patients with strabismus and 16 controls during fixation and visually guided saccades under monocular viewing conditions. Fixational saccades and intersaccadic drifts were analysed in the viewing and non-viewing eye of patients with strabismus and controls.
Results We found an increase in fixational instability in patients with strabismus compared with controls. We also found an increase in the disconjugacy of fixational saccades and intrasaccadic ocular drift in patients with strabismus compared with controls. The disconjugacy was worse in patients with large-angle strabismus and absent stereopsis. There was an increase in eye position variance during drifts in patients with strabismus. Our findings suggest that both fixational saccades and intersaccadic drifts are abnormal and likely contribute to the fixational instability in patients with strabismus.
Discussion Fixational instability could be a useful tool for mass screenings of children to diagnose strabismus in the absence of amblyopia and latent nystagmus. The increased disconjugacy of fixational eye movements and visually guided saccades in patients with strabismus reflects the disruption of the fine-tuning of the motor and visual systems responsible for achieving binocular fusion in these patients.","Ghasia, Fatema F (https://www.notion.so/Ghasia-Fatema-F-204d9ba792184b0e9dca1f0739831162?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Shaikh, Aasef G (https://www.notion.so/Shaikh-Aasef-G-222ee231c59347b595169eb1d634a819?pvs=21)","Ghasia, Otero-Millan, Shaikh",Diagnosis,"Br J Ophthalmol. 2018 Feb;102(2):253-259.

Triggering mechanisms in microsaccade and saccade generation: a novel proposal.,"Saccades are rapid eye movements that change the line of sight between successive points of fixation. Even as we attempt to fixate our gaze precisely, small rapid eye movements called microsaccades interrupt fixation one or two times each second. Although the neural pathway controlling saccade generation is well understood, the specific mechanism for triggering microsaccades is unknown. Here, we review the evidence suggesting that microsaccades and saccades are generated by the same neural pathway. We also discuss current models of how the saccadic system produces microsaccades. Finally, we propose a new mechanism for triggering both microsaccades and saccades, based on a circuit formed by omnipause and long-lead burst neurons and driven by activity in the superior colliculus. Our model differs from previous proposals in that it does not require superior colliculus activity to surpass a particular threshold to trigger microsaccades and saccades. Rather, we propose that the reciprocal inhibition between omnipause and long-lead burst neurons gates each microsaccadic or saccadic event, triggering the eye movement whenever the activity in the long-lead burst neurons overcomes the inhibition from the omnipause neurons.","Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","Otero-Millan, Macknik, Martinez-Conde",Ocular motor control,"Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2011 Sep;1233:107-16.

Distinctive features of microsaccades in Alzheimer's disease and in mild cognitive impairment.,"During visual fixation, the eyes are never completely still, but produce small involuntary movements, called ""fixational eye movements,"" including microsaccades, drift, and tremor. In certain neurological disorders, attempted fixation results in abnormal fixational eye movements with distinctive characteristics. Thus, determining how normal fixation differs from pathological fixation has the potential to aid early and differential noninvasive diagnosis of neurological disease as well as the quantification of its progression and response to treatment. Here, we recorded the eye movements produced by patients with Alzheimer's disease, patients with mild cognitive impairment, and healthy age-matched individuals during attempted fixation. We found that microsaccade magnitudes, velocities, durations, and intersaccadic intervals were comparable in the three subject groups, but microsaccade direction differed in patients versus healthy subjects. Our results indicate that microsaccades are more prevalently oblique in patients with Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment than in healthy subjects. These findings extended to those microsaccades paired in square-wave jerks, supporting the hypothesis that microsaccades and square-wave jerks form a continuum, both in healthy subjects and in neurological patients","Kapoula, Zoi (https://www.notion.so/Kapoula-Zoi-cd66679bee68414c8b63f76af02138f3?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Yang, Q (https://www.notion.so/Yang-Q-5edddc810fd6437dacb40d74f024a91d?pvs=21), Xiao, S (https://www.notion.so/Xiao-S-624a821905164ca8b1ad4b20f5ec90d2?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), Lang, A (https://www.notion.so/Lang-A-51a36924c1ea473c812eb6f2a5c00cf2?pvs=21), Verny, M (https://www.notion.so/Verny-M-6f18da66226b4c349006c447989053fb?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","Kapoula, Otero-Millan, Yang, Xiao, Macknik, Lang, Verny, Martinez-Conde",Diagnosis,"Age (Dordr). 2014 Apr;36(2):535-43.

Gravity-Independent Upbeat Nystagmus in Syndrome of Anti-GAD Antibodies.,"An autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system, stiff person syndrome, frequently presents with increased titers of 65KD anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) antibodies. The clinical phenomenology of this syndrome includes stiffness, ataxia, vertigo due to horizontal gaze-evoked and downbeat vertical nystagmus, and dysmetria of saccades and reaching movements. Here, we describe a novel phenomenology of syndrome of anti-GAD antibody, non-position-dependent upbeat nystagmus and superimposed horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus. Lack of gravity dependence of primary position upbeat nystagmus, intense nystagmus on up-gaze, relatively stable gaze on downward orientation, and the exponentially decaying waveform suggests neural integrator dysfunction. The titer of anti-GAD in our patient (30 U/ml) was consistent with a variant called ""low-titer anti-GAD syndrome"".

Three-dimensional eye movement recordings during magnetic vestibular stimulation.,"Human subjects placed in strong magnetic fields such as in an MRI scanner often feel dizzy or vertiginous. Recent studies in humans and animals have shown that these effects arise from stimulation of the labyrinth and are accompanied by nystagmus. Here, we measured the three-dimensional pattern of nystagmus using video eye tracking in five normal human subjects placed in a 7T MRI to infer which semicircular canals are activated by magnetic vestibular stimulation. We found that the nystagmus usually had a torsional as well as a horizontal component. Analysis of the relative velocities of the three eye movement components revealed that the lateral and anterior (superior) canals are the only canals activated, and by a similar amount.","Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Zee, David S (https://www.notion.so/Zee-David-S-a54d8115dd39404fa3fbe60216ee1f7c?pvs=21), Schubert, Michael (https://www.notion.so/Schubert-Michael-be9dd5934032430296fbd811266b54c6?pvs=21), Roberts, Dale C (https://www.notion.so/Roberts-Dale-C-1095dbbb31614cf49f3a8924321165b6?pvs=21), Ward, Bryan K (https://www.notion.so/Ward-Bryan-K-4f440f4f82b64b5faf9300fa9ab9bae5?pvs=21)","Otero-Millan, Zee, Schubert, Roberts, Ward",Ocular motor control,"J Neurol. 2017 Oct;264(Suppl 1):7-12.

Evaluation of the Video Ocular Counter-Roll (vOCR) as a New Clinical Test of Otolith Function in Peripheral Vestibulopathy,"Importance Video-oculography (VOG) goggles have been integrated into the assessment of semicircular canal function in patients with vestibular disorders. However, a similar bedside VOG method for testing otolith function is lacking.
Objective To evaluate the use of VOG-based measurement of ocular counter-roll (vOCR) as a clinical test of otolith function.
Design, Setting, and Participants A case-control study was conducted to compare vOCR measurement among patients at various stages of unilateral loss of vestibular function with healthy controls. The receiver operating characteristic curve method was used to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the vOCR test in detecting loss of otolith function. Participants were recruited at a tertiary center including the Johns Hopkins outpatient clinic and Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland. Participants included 56 individuals with acute (≤4 weeks after surgery), subacute (4 weeks-6 months after surgery), and chronic (>6 months after surgery) unilateral vestibular loss as well as healthy controls. A simple bedside maneuver with en bloc, 30° lateral tilt of the head and trunk was used for vOCR measurement. The study was conducted from February 2, 2017, to March 10, 2019.
Intervention In each participant vOCR was measured during static tilts of the head and trunk en bloc.
Main Outcomes and Measures The vOCR measurements and diagnostic accuracy of vOCR in detecting patients with loss of vestibular function from healthy controls.
Results Of the 56 participants, 28 (50.0%) were men; mean (SD) age was 53.5 (11.4) years. The mean (SD) time of acute unilateral vestibular loss was 9 (7) days (range, 2-17 days) in the acute group, 61 (39) days (range, 28-172 days) in the subacute group, and 985 (1066) days (range 185-4200 days) in the chronic group. The vOCR test showed reduction on the side of vestibular loss, and the deficit was greater in patients with acute and subacute vestibular loss than in patients with chronic loss and healthy controls (acute vs chronic: −1.81°; 95% CI, −3.45° to −0.17°; acute vs control: −3.18°; 95% CI, −4.83° to −1.54°; subacute vs chronic: −0.63°; 95% CI, −2.28° to 1.01°; subacute vs control: −2.01°; 95% CI, −3.65° to −0.36°; acute vs subacute: −1.17°; 95% CI, −2.88° to 0.52°; and chronic vs control: −1.37°; 95% CI, −2.96° to 0.21°). The asymmetry in vOCR between the side of vestibular loss and healthy side was significantly higher in patients with acute vs chronic loss (0.28; 95% CI, 0.06-0.51). Overall, the performance of the vOCR test in discriminating between patients with vestibular loss and healthy controls was 0.83 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve). The best vOCR threshold to detect vestibular loss at the 30° tilt was 4.5°, with a sensitivity of 80% (95% CI, 0.62%-0.88%) and specificity of 82% (95% CI, 0.57%-1.00%).
Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this case-control study suggest that the vOCR test can be performed with a simple bedside maneuver and may be used to detect or track loss of otolith function.","Sadeghpour, Shirin (https://www.notion.so/Sadeghpour-Shirin-bc5c3d114f03477fab01d009fe76dbfb?pvs=21), Fornasari, Francesco (https://www.notion.so/Fornasari-Francesco-da6d32653c24428dbeb6fe5aa7760d2f?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Carey, John P (https://www.notion.so/Carey-John-P-b8532aeefbf046ab89291c9e52330c78?pvs=21), Zee, David S (https://www.notion.so/Zee-David-S-a54d8115dd39404fa3fbe60216ee1f7c?pvs=21), Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21)","Sadeghpour, Fornasari, Otero-Millan, Carey, Zee, Kheradmand","Diagnosis, Ocular motor control","JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg.

Proof of Concept for an “eyePhone” App to Measure Video Head Impulses,"Objective: Differentiating benign from dangerous causes of dizziness or vertigo presents a major diagnostic challenge for many clinicians. Bedside presentations of peripheral vestibular disorders and posterior fossa strokes are often indistinguishable other than by a few subtle vestibular eye movements. The most challenging of these to interpret is the head impulse test (HIT) of vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) function. There have been major advances in portable video-oculography (VOG) quantification of the video HIT (vHIT), but these specialized devices are not routinely available in most clinical settings. As a first step towards smartphone-based diagnosis of strokes in patients presenting vestibular symptoms, we sought proof of concept that we could use a smartphone application (“app”) to accurately record the vHIT. Methods: This was a cross-sectional agreement study comparing a novel index test (smartphone-based vHIT app) to an accepted reference standard test (VOG-based vHIT) for measuring VOR function. We recorded passive (examiner-performed) vHIT sequentially with both methods in a convenience sample of patients visiting an otoneurology clinic. We quantitatively correlated VOR gains (ratio of eye to head movements during the HIT) from each side/ear and experts qualitatively assessed the physiologic traces by the two methods. Results: We recruited 11 patients; 1 patient’s vHIT could not be reliably quantified with either device. The novel and reference test VOR gain measurements for each ear (n = 20) were highly correlated (Pearson’s r = 0.9, p = 0.0000001) and, qualitatively, clinically equivalent. Conclusions: This preliminary study provides proof of concept that an “eyePhone” app could be used to measure vHIT and eventually developed to diagnose vestibular strokes by smartphone.","Parker, Taylor Max  (https://www.notion.so/Parker-Taylor-Max-337b919484514136a42ec968d09effa9?pvs=21), Farrel, Nathan (https://www.notion.so/Farrel-Nathan-1368849949da4171a2523af893eb32b0?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21), McClenney, Ayodele (https://www.notion.so/McClenney-Ayodele-0b756576bfc44cdbac4b8d249f5d9a04?pvs=21), Newman-Toker, David (https://www.notion.so/Newman-Toker-David-2f472e57d2d341598c1d5dd5bdb48240?pvs=21)","Parker, Farrel, Otero-Millan, Kheradmand, McClenney, Newman-Toker","Diagnosis, Ocular motor control",Digit Biomark 2021;5:1–8,"July 16, 2020 11:50 AM",10.1159/000511287,,511287.pdf,"Parker, Taylor Max  (https://www.notion.so/Parker-Taylor-Max-337b919484514136a42ec968d09effa9?pvs=21)",,Digital Biomarkers,"December 5, 2022 2:47 PM",https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/511287,,EyePhone,,,,,"December 30, 2020",,"Newman-Toker, David (https://www.notion.so/Newman-Toker-David-2f472e57d2d341598c1d5dd5bdb48240?pvs=21)",,Published🎉,,"Diagnosis (https://www.notion.so/Diagnosis-dd0da3ca4a8a4aa689a28fb2c70ec623?pvs=21), Telemedicine (https://www.notion.so/Telemedicine-33c3d00c1d5149728ba2c41793c89694?pvs=21), Eye tracking (https://www.notion.so/Eye-tracking-4be05eee214f43779ec0b220e6990df3?pvs=21)",Research article,2020,

Microsaccade generation requires a foveal anchor,"Visual scene characteristics have the ability to affect various aspects of saccade and microsaccade dynamics. For example, blank visual scenes are known to elicit diminished saccade and microsaccade production, compared to natural scenes. Similarly, microsaccades are less frequent in the dark. Yet, the extent to which foveal and peripheral visual information contribute to microsaccade production remains unclear: because microsaccade are directed to covert attention locations as per the superior colliculus activation map, it follows that peripheral stimulation could suffice to produce regular microsaccade dynamics, even without foveal stimulation being present. Here we compared the characteristics of microsaccades generated in the presence or absence of foveal and/or peripheral visual stimulation, while human subjects conducted four types of oculomotor tasks (fixation, free-viewing, guided-viewing and fixation during passive viewing). Foveal information was either available, or made unavailable by the presentation of both solid and blurred scotomas. We found foveal stimulation to be critical for microsaccade production, and peripheral stimulation, by itself, to be insufficient to yield microsaccades. Our results indicate that a foveal visual anchor is necessary for microsaccade generation.","Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Langston, Rachel E (https://www.notion.so/Langston-Rachel-E-98db28fde59a419dafac61f81ae3eb20?pvs=21), Costela, Francisco M (https://www.notion.so/Costela-Francisco-M-333d3e8a16544a169f1bd5c6826b7534?pvs=21), Macknik, Stephen L (https://www.notion.so/Macknik-Stephen-L-e2a97e48e3a945a597dcfecef69df7a3?pvs=21), Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)","Otero-Millan, Langston, Costela, Macknik, Martinez-Conde",Ocular motor control,"Journal of Eye Movement Research, 12(6)","July 16, 2020 11:50 AM",10.16910/jemr.12.6.14,,Otero-Millan_et_al._-_2020_-_Microsaccade_generation_requires_a_foveal_anchor.pdf,"Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21)",,JEMR,"April 22, 2021 2:25 PM",https://bop.unibe.ch/JEMR/article/view/JEMR.12.6.14,,Scotoma,,,,,"June 29, 2020",,"Martinez-Conde, Susana (https://www.notion.so/Martinez-Conde-Susana-204c815dd8e54cbb898598d9660ecae5?pvs=21)",,Published🎉,,Ocular motor control (https://www.notion.so/Ocular-motor-control-e62515c7db9d4b699311e625070c2c7b?pvs=21),Research article,2020,
Part time patching treatment outcomes in children with amblyopia with and without Fusion Maldevelopment Nystagmus: an eye movement study.,"Purpose
We investigated how the abnormalities of fixation eye movements (FEMs) of the amblyopic eye were linked with treatment outcomes following part-time patching therapy in children with amblyopia.
Methods
We recruited 53 patients, with at least 12 months of patching, and measured FEMs at the end of treatment. Subjects were classified based on FEM waveforms (those without nystagmus = 21, those with nystagmus without fusion maldevelopment nystagmus (FMN) = 21, and those with FMN = 11) and based on clinical type of amblyopia (anisometropic = 18, strabismic = 6, and mixed = 29). The treatment outcomes such as duration of treatment of receiving part-time patching therapy, visual acuity and stereo-acuity deficits at the end of treatment were determined. Bivariate contour ellipse area (BCEA), fast (fixational saccade/quick phases), and slow (inter-saccadic drifts/slow phases) FEMs of the fellow and amblyopic eye were analyzed.
Results
Anisometropic group had less residual amblyopia (0.23±0.19logMAR acuity) compared to strabismic/mixed (0.36±0.26) groups (p = 0.007). Treatment duration in patients without nystagmus was lower (12.6±9.5months) compared to nystagmus without FMN (25.6±23.2) and FMN (29.5±20.4) groups (p = 0.006). Patients without nystagmus had better stereopsis at the end of treatment (2.3±0.84logarcsecs) compared to nystagmus without FMN (2.6±0.84) group (p = 0.003). The majority of patients with FMN (8/11) had absent stereopsis. BCEA of the amblyopic eye was higher in patients with greater residual visual acuity deficits in patients without nystagmus. No such association was seen in Nystagmus no FMN and FMN groups. Increased amplitude of fast FEMs, increased eye position variance and eye velocity of slow FEMs were seen in patients who had received longer duration of part time patching therapy and in those with greater residual amblyopia, and poor stereopsis at the end of treatment.
Conclusions
Assessment of FEM waveforms and fast and slow FEM characteristics are important measures while describing fixation instability in amblyopia. Several FEM abnormalities were associated with stereo-acuity and visual acuity deficits and treatment duration in patients with amblyopia treated with part time patching therapy.","Scaramuzzi, Matteo (https://www.notion.so/Scaramuzzi-Matteo-0e6223b4ddfe4128a789cc4b58af0b3b?pvs=21), Murray, Jordan (https://www.notion.so/Murray-Jordan-8bf59185da5c4094bcd6da6bb539f926?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Nucci, Paolo (https://www.notion.so/Nucci-Paolo-c58246cd73594902aef5c565ef6db2fe?pvs=21), Shaikh, Aasef G (https://www.notion.so/Shaikh-Aasef-G-222ee231c59347b595169eb1d634a819?pvs=21), Ghasia, Fatema F (https://www.notion.so/Ghasia-Fatema-F-204d9ba792184b0e9dca1f0739831162?pvs=21)","Scaramuzzi, Murray, Otero-Millan, Nucci, Shaikh, Ghasia",Diagnosis,PLOS ONE 15(8): e0237346.,"July 24, 2020 8:02 AM",10.1371/journal.pone.0237346,,journal.pone.0237346.pdf,"Scaramuzzi, Matteo (https://www.notion.so/Scaramuzzi-Matteo-0e6223b4ddfe4128a789cc4b58af0b3b?pvs=21)",,PLoS One,"April 22, 2021 2:18 PM",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237346,,,,,,,"August 13, 2020",,"Ghasia, Fatema F (https://www.notion.so/Ghasia-Fatema-F-204d9ba792184b0e9dca1f0739831162?pvs=21)",,Published🎉,,Diagnosis (https://www.notion.so/Diagnosis-dd0da3ca4a8a4aa689a28fb2c70ec623?pvs=21),Research article,2020,
Detection of Saccades and Quick-Phases in Eye Movement Recordings with Nystagmus,"Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of vertigo and dizziness. Patients with those symptoms can be diagnosed by the presence of a specific pattern of nystagmus during the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. However, almost half of dizzy patients visiting Emergency Department (ED) are misdiagnosed, leading to significant morbidity and high medical costs. This can be attributed to the lack of specialized expertise of front-line physicians and to the lack of validated automatic commercial devices and software for nystagmus detection and quantification. Here we aim to enhance saccade detection thereby improving automatic nystagmus quantification. The proposed method is evaluated on a nystagmus dataset recorded from patients in the ED as they undergo the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. Additionally, the proposed method is also tested on a publicly available saccade dataset and compared with state-of-the-art eye movement detection methods.","Punugati, Sai A (https://www.notion.so/Punugati-Sai-A-d0026b57417a4eb39da28ecdfa559af6?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21)","Punugati, Otero-Millan",Measuring eye movements,ETRA '20 Short Papers: ACM Symposium on Eye Tracking Research and Applications. 2020;8:1–5,"July 24, 2020 1:59 PM",10.1145/3379156.3391353,,Punuganti_and_PhD_-_2020_-_Detection_of_Saccades_and_Quick-Phases_in_Eye_Move.pdf,"Punugati, Sai A (https://www.notion.so/Punugati-Sai-A-d0026b57417a4eb39da28ecdfa559af6?pvs=21)",,ETRA,"September 2, 2021 8:41 AM",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3379156.3391353,,Nystagmus detection,,,,,"June 2, 2020",,"Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21)",,Published🎉,,"Ocular motor control (https://www.notion.so/Ocular-motor-control-e62515c7db9d4b699311e625070c2c7b?pvs=21), Eye tracking (https://www.notion.so/Eye-tracking-4be05eee214f43779ec0b220e6990df3?pvs=21)",Research article,2020,

Remote evaluation of acute vertigo: Strategies and technological considerations,"Patients with acute vestibular disorders are often a diagnostic challenge for neurologists, especially when the evaluation must be conducted remotely. The clinical dilemma remains: Does the patient have a benign peripheral inner ear problem or a worrisome central vestibular disorder, such as a stroke? The use of a focused history and the virtual HINTS (head impulse test, nystagmus evaluation, and test of skew) examination are key steps towards correctly diagnosing and triaging the acute vertiginous patient. When looking for signs of vestibulo-ocular dysfunction, there are important technological and practical considerations for an effective clinical interpretation.","Green, Kemar (https://www.notion.so/Green-Kemar-aeff744826f44aaf8b6fc0f85d88dccd?pvs=21), Pogson, Jacob (https://www.notion.so/Pogson-Jacob-19f33cd354d24cbb894c4cb1d336c67d?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Gold, Dan R (https://www.notion.so/Gold-Dan-R-3f7a72785d88433d8d3eb94a7055e782?pvs=21), Tevzadze, Nana (https://www.notion.so/Tevzadze-Nana-49267ca6ce944ce593cc088e3f15b5c0?pvs=21), Saber Tehrani, Ali S (https://www.notion.so/Saber-Tehrani-Ali-S-6524c3f76bdc47a2bd273789d9f98810?pvs=21), Zee, David S (https://www.notion.so/Zee-David-S-a54d8115dd39404fa3fbe60216ee1f7c?pvs=21), Newman-Toker, David (https://www.notion.so/Newman-Toker-David-2f472e57d2d341598c1d5dd5bdb48240?pvs=21), Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21)","Green, Pogson, Otero-Millan, Gold, Tevzadze, Saber Tehrani, Zee, Newman-Toker, Kheradmand",Diagnosis,"Neurology Jan 2021, 96 (1) 34-38","September 11, 2020 7:55 PM",10.1212/WNL.0000000000010980,,,"Green, Kemar (https://www.notion.so/Green-Kemar-aeff744826f44aaf8b6fc0f85d88dccd?pvs=21)",,Neurology,"April 22, 2021 2:17 PM",https://n.neurology.org/content/96/1/34.abstract,,,,33004609,,,"January 5, 2021",,"Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21)",,Published🎉,,Diagnosis (https://www.notion.so/Diagnosis-dd0da3ca4a8a4aa689a28fb2c70ec623?pvs=21),Review,2020,

"Fixational Eye Movements in Visual, Cognitive, and Movement Disorders","The eyes never remain completely still. Even when attempting to maintain our gaze stable looking at a small target, fixational eye movements keep the eyes in constant motion. Given the simplicity of the task and the rich dataset that can be obtained, the interest in fixational eye movements has grown in multiple research and clinical fields. First, this chapter reviews the general classes of eye movements and how they may contribute to the main two components of fixational eye movements: drifts and microsaccades. While microsaccades are considered to be part of a continuum with saccades, drift results from a combination of all other smooth eye movements, such as vestibular ocular reflex, smooth pursuit, and vergence. Then, it discusses the methods used to analyze fixational eye movements and what are the typical parameters of interest and some considerations on how they should be measured. Finally, it describes how fixational eye movements are altered in patients affected by different degrees of vision loss, by movement disorders, or by cognitive disorders.","Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21)",Otero-Millan,"Diagnosis, Ocular motor control","In: Shaikh A., Ghasia F.

Torsional component of microsaccades during fixation and quick phases during optokinetic stimulation,"While many studies have characterized the eye movements during visual fixation, including microsaccades, in most cases only horizontal and vertical components have been recorded and analyzed. Thus, little is known about the torsional component of microsaccades. We took advantage of a newly developed software and hardware to record eye movements around the three axes of rotation during fixation and torsional optokinetic stimulus. We found that the average amplitude of the torsional component of microsaccades during fixation was 0.34 ± 0.07 degrees with velocities following a main sequence with a slope comparable to the horizontal and vertical components. We also found the size of the torsional displacement during microsaccades was correlated with the horizontal but not the vertical component. In the presence of an optokinetic stimulus a nystagmus was induced producing a more frequent and larger torsional quick phases compared to microsaccades produced during fixation with a stationary stimulus. The torsional component and the vertical vergence component of quick phases grew larger with higher velocities. Additionally, our results validate and show the feasibility of recording torsional eye movements using video eye tracking in a desktop mounted setup.","Sadeghpour, Shirin (https://www.notion.so/Sadeghpour-Shirin-bc5c3d114f03477fab01d009fe76dbfb?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21)","Sadeghpour, Otero-Millan",Ocular motor control,"Journal of Eye Movement Research, 13(5)","October 28, 2020 6:48 PM",https://doi.org/10.16910/jemr.13.5.5,"Groner, Rudolf (https://www.notion.so/Groner-Rudolf-13ee1997179e4ec38e405dd51589b51b?pvs=21)",4373-Article_Text-28309-1-10-20201208_(3).pdf,"Sadeghpour, Shirin (https://www.notion.so/Sadeghpour-Shirin-bc5c3d114f03477fab01d009fe76dbfb?pvs=21)",Untitled (https://www.notion.so/5a7a2a691e84474b9e008e67167bcf5d?pvs=21),JEMR,"December 5, 2022 2:47 PM",https://bop.unibe.ch/JEMR/article/view/JEMR.13.5.5,,Microsaccade torsion,,,"https://www.notion.so/e62515c7db9d4b699311e625070c2c7b,https://www.notion.so/e62515c7db9d4b699311e625070c2c7b, https://www.notion.so/fe36c28ce4764d968b63a11202d226a6",,"October 10, 2020","Van Rijn 1994 (https://www.notion.so/Van-Rijn-1994-884da420eb484e489d50f06551016755?pvs=21), Main sequence of torsional saccadic eye movement – analysis by three-dimensional video-oculography (https://www.notion.so/Main-sequence-of-torsional-saccadic-eye-movement-analysis-by-three-dimensional-video-oculography-3fd16b582b19416387f11acec18e17a8?pvs=21)","Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21)",,Published🎉,,"Torsion (https://www.notion.so/Torsion-349efb631fa94f8381104b32760d2079?pvs=21), Microsaccades (https://www.notion.so/Microsaccades-19ccd07295344b9284fab3080c238f03?pvs=21)",Research article,2020,

Fixational eye movement waveforms in amblyopia: Characteristics of fast and slow eye movements,"Fixational eye movements comprise of fast microsaccades alternating with slow inter-saccadic drifts. These physiologic eye movements play an important role in visual perception. Amblyopic patients are known to have fixation instability, particularly of the amblyopic eye. We examined eye movement abnormalities that contribute to this instability. We found that fixation stability is affected by the presence of fusion maldevelopment nystagmus (FMN). However, some amblyopes can have nystagmus without nasally directed slow phases and reversal in direction of the quick phase on ocular occlusion, features seen in FMN. In patients without nystagmus, we found increased amplitude of fixational saccades and inter-saccadic drifts. We categorized amblyopia patients by type (anisometropic, strabismic, or mixed) and eye movement waveform (no nystagmus, nystagmus without FMN, and FMN). We found specific fast and slow eye movement abnormalities of the fellow and amblyopic eye during fellow, amblyopic and both eyes viewing conditions across eye movement waveforms and types of amblyopia. These eye movement abnormalities can serve as biomarkers that can predict the impact of amblyopia as measured by visual acuity and stereopsis. Evaluation of fixational eye movements in amblyopia could be important to diagnose these common eye diseases and predict treatment effectiveness.","Kang, Sarah Linda (https://www.notion.so/Kang-Sarah-Linda-d0dfb761d10644678393f386e390e500?pvs=21), Beylergil, Sinem B (https://www.notion.so/Beylergil-Sinem-B-35ac1e2f3c8e4708b787677cbb494098?pvs=21), Shaikh, Aasef G (https://www.notion.so/Shaikh-Aasef-G-222ee231c59347b595169eb1d634a819?pvs=21), Ghasia, Fatema F (https://www.notion.so/Ghasia-Fatema-F-204d9ba792184b0e9dca1f0739831162?pvs=21)","Kang, Beylergil, Shaikh, Ghasia",Diagnosis,"Journal of Eye Movement Research, 12(6)","February 27, 2021 8:41 AM",https://doi.org/10.16910/jemr.12.6.9,,,"Kang, Sarah Linda (https://www.notion.so/Kang-Sarah-Linda-d0dfb761d10644678393f386e390e500?pvs=21)",,JEMR,"April 22, 2021 2:16 PM",https://bop.unibe.ch/JEMR/article/view/4335-Kang_et_al.,,,,,https://www.notion.so/e62515c7db9d4b699311e625070c2c7b,,"July 5, 2019",,"Ghasia, Fatema F (https://www.notion.so/Ghasia-Fatema-F-204d9ba792184b0e9dca1f0739831162?pvs=21)",,Published🎉,,FEMs (https://www.notion.so/FEMs-fe36c28ce4764d968b63a11202d226a6?pvs=21),Research article,2019,

Head Orientation Influences Saccade Directions during Free Viewing,"When looking around a visual scene, humans make saccadic eye movements to fixate objects of interest. While the extraocular muscles can execute saccades in any direction, not all saccade directions are equally likely: saccades in horizontal and vertical directions are most prevalent. Here, we asked whether head orientation plays a role in determining saccade direction biases. Study participants (n = 14) viewed natural scenes and abstract fractals (radially symmetric patterns) through a virtual reality headset equipped with eye tracking. Participants’ heads were stabilized and tilted at −30°, 0°, or 30° while viewing the images, which could also be tilted by −30°, 0°, and 30° relative to the head. To determine whether the biases in saccade direction changed with head tilt, we calculated polar histograms of saccade directions and cross-correlated pairs of histograms to find the angular displacement resulting in the maximum correlation. During free viewing of fractals, saccade biases largely followed the orientation of the head with an average displacement value of 24° when comparing head upright to head tilt in world-referenced coordinates (t(13) = 17.63, p < 0.001). There was a systematic offset of 2.6° in saccade directions, likely reflecting ocular counter roll (OCR; t(13) = 3.13, p = 0.008). When participants viewed an Earth upright natural scene during head tilt, we found that the orientation of the head still influenced saccade directions (t(13) = 3.7, p = 0.001).

"Modeling the Interaction among Three Cerebellar Disorders of Eye Movements: Periodic Alternating, Gaze-evoked and Rebound Nystagmus","A woman, age 44, with a positive anti-YO paraneoplastic cerebellar syndrome and normal imaging developed an ocular motor disorder including periodic alternating nystagmus (PAN), gaze-evoked nystagmus (GEN) and rebound nystagmus (RN). During fixation there was typical PAN but changes in gaze position evoked complex, time-varying oscillations of GEN and RN. To unravel the pathophysiology of this unusual pattern of nystagmus, we developed a mathematical model of normal function of the circuits mediating the vestibular-ocular reflex and gaze-holding including their adaptive mechanisms. Simulations showed that all the findings of our patient could be explained by two, small, isolated changes in cerebellar circuits: reducing the time constant of the gaze-holding integrator, producing GEN and RN, and increasing the gain of the vestibular velocity-storage positive feedback loop, producing PAN. We conclude that the gaze- and time-varying pattern of nystagmus in our patient can be accounted for by superposition of one model that produces typical PAN and another model that produces typical GEN and RN, without requiring a new oscillator in the gaze-holding system or a more complex, nonlinear interaction between the two models. This analysis suggest a strategy for uncovering gaze-evoked and rebound nystagmus in the setting of a time-varying nystagmus such as PAN. Our results are also consistent with current ideas of compartmentalization of cerebellar functions for the control of the vestibular velocity-storage mechanism (nodulus and ventral uvula) and for holding horizontal gaze steady (the flocculus and tonsil).","Shemesh, Ari (https://www.notion.so/Shemesh-Ari-a886476d06474e9dbe707e36c608b311?pvs=21), Kocoglu, Koray (https://www.notion.so/Kocoglu-Koray-409fffddbce94ee88a1f65ea12d2c760?pvs=21), Akdal, Gulden (https://www.notion.so/Akdal-Gulden-ff9f58a8f9e349999683aee74fae3b1f?pvs=21), Tumay Ala, Rahmi (https://www.notion.so/Tumay-Ala-Rahmi-c2f550f014c84f80947a6ce08594c5f2?pvs=21), Halmagyi, G.

Eye tracking: empirical foundations for a minimal reporting guideline,"In this paper, we present a review of how the various aspects of any study using an eye tracker (such as the instrument, methodology, environment, participant, etc.) affect the quality of the recorded eye-tracking data and the obtained eye-movement and gaze measures. We take this review to represent the empirical foundation for reporting guidelines of any study involving an eye tracker. We compare this empirical foundation to five existing reporting guidelines and to a database of 207 published eye-tracking studies. We find that reporting guidelines vary substantially and do not match with actual reporting practices. We end by deriving a minimal, flexible reporting guideline based on empirical research (Section “https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-021-01762-8#Sec72”).","Holmqvist, Kenneth (https://www.notion.so/Holmqvist-Kenneth-f8211511c6d44392aa007bee68521479?pvs=21), Hessels, Roy (https://www.notion.so/Hessels-Roy-d28c2ee7a8c44aba972d02254e01431e?pvs=21)","Holmqvist, Hessels",Measuring eye movements,Behavior Research Methods (2022),"May 8, 2021 8:41 AM",,,,"Holmqvist, Kenneth (https://www.notion.so/Holmqvist-Kenneth-f8211511c6d44392aa007bee68521479?pvs=21)",,Behavior Research Methods,"June 28, 2024 10:15 PM",https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-021-01762-8,,EyeTrackingReportingGuidelines,,,,,,,"Hessels, Roy (https://www.notion.so/Hessels-Roy-d28c2ee7a8c44aba972d02254e01431e?pvs=21)",,✋On hold,,Eye tracking (https://www.notion.so/Eye-tracking-4be05eee214f43779ec0b220e6990df3?pvs=21),Review,2022,
Psychophysical haptic measurement of vertical perception: Elucidating a hand­ sensory bias,"The primary sensory modality for probing spatial perception can vary among psychophysical paradigms. In the subjective visual vertical (SVV) task, the brain must account for the position of the eye within the orbit to generate an estimate of a visual line orientation, whereas in the subjective haptic vertical (SHV) task, the position of the hand is used to sense the orientation of a haptic bar. Here we investigated whether a hand sensory bias can affect SHV measurement. We measured SHV in 12 subjects (6 left-handed and 6 right-handed) with a forced-choice paradigm using their left and right hands separately. The SHV measurement was less accurate than the SVV measurements (−0.6 ± 0.7) and it was biased in the direction of the hand used in the task but was not affected by handedness; SHV left hand −6.8 ± 2.1° (left-handed −7.9 ± 3.6°, right-handed −5.8 ± 2.5°) and right hand 9.8 ± 1.5° (left-handed 7.4 ± 2.2°, right-handed 12.3 ± 1.8°). SHV measurement with the same hand was also affected by the haptic bar placement on the left or right side versus midline, showing a side effect (left vs midline −2.0 ± 1.3°, right vs midline 3.8 ± 1.7°). Midline SHV measures using the left and right hands were different, confirming a laterality effect (left hand −4.5 ± 1.7°, right hand 6.4 ± 2.0°). These results demonstrate a sensory bias in SHV measurement related to the effects of both hand-in-body (i.e., right vs left hand) and hand-in-space positions. Such modality-specific bias may result in disparity between SHV and SVV measurements, and therefore cannot be generalized to vertical or spatial perception.","Kim, Min Jung (https://www.notion.so/Kim-Min-Jung-3563d78567d243db964fde4d09915ef8?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Tian, Jing (https://www.notion.so/Tian-Jing-5aea07edc0084c9ab2b2202b8544a8a8?pvs=21), Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21)","Kim, Otero-Millan, Tian, Kheradmand",Vision while moving,"Neuroscience, 481, 21-29","May 18, 2021 9:42 AM",10.1016/j.neuroscience.2021.11.037,,,"Kim, Min Jung (https://www.notion.so/Kim-Min-Jung-3563d78567d243db964fde4d09915ef8?pvs=21)",,Neuroscience,"December 10, 2021 10:05 AM",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452221006047,,hapticsvv,,,,,"January 15, 2022",,"Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21)",,Published🎉,,Vision while moving (https://www.notion.so/Vision-while-moving-e5fbfa2036ad40b3b8e4a7a1a95f4a08?pvs=21),Research article,2021,
Effects of visual blur on microsaccades during visual exploration,"Microsaccades shift the image on the fovea and counteract visual fading. They also serve as an optimal sampling strategy while viewing complex visual scenes. Microsaccade production relies on the amount of retinal error or acuity demand of a visual task. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of blur induced by uncorrected refractive error on visual search. Eye movements were recorded in fourteen healthy subjects with uncorrected and corrected refractive error while they performed a) visual fixation b) blank-scene viewing c) visual search (spot the difference) tasks. Microsaccades, saccades, correctly identified differences and reaction times were analyzed. The frequency of microsaccades and correctly identified differences were lower in the uncorrected refractive error during visual search. No similar change in microsaccades was seen during blank-scene viewing and gaze holding tasks. These findings suggest that visual blur, hence the precision of an image on the fovea, has an important role in calibrating the amplitude of microsaccades during visual scanning.","Tang, Sherry (https://www.notion.so/Tang-Sherry-e711621161b943da8c718b061c1f29e9?pvs=21), Skelly, Peggy (https://www.notion.so/Skelly-Peggy-8401704aeb414d53b4363b4a976cfecf?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Jacobs, Jonathan (https://www.notion.so/Jacobs-Jonathan-05ec458806db49a88e7c4b77a475a0ec?pvs=21), Murray, Jordan (https://www.notion.so/Murray-Jordan-8bf59185da5c4094bcd6da6bb539f926?pvs=21), Shaikh, Aasef G (https://www.notion.so/Shaikh-Aasef-G-222ee231c59347b595169eb1d634a819?pvs=21), Ghasia, Fatema F (https://www.notion.so/Ghasia-Fatema-F-204d9ba792184b0e9dca1f0739831162?pvs=21)","Tang, Skelly, Otero-Millan, Jacobs, Murray, Shaikh, Ghasia",Ocular motor control,"Journal of Eye Movement Research, 12(6).","May 19, 2021 4:06 PM",10.16910/jemr.12.6.10,,,"Tang, Sherry (https://www.notion.so/Tang-Sherry-e711621161b943da8c718b061c1f29e9?pvs=21)",,JEMR,"May 19, 2021 4:10 PM",https://bop.unibe.ch/JEMR/article/view/4369-Tangetal-Article.pdf,,,,,"https://www.notion.so/e62515c7db9d4b699311e625070c2c7b, https://www.notion.so/fe36c28ce4764d968b63a11202d226a6",,"August 12, 2019",,"Ghasia, Fatema F (https://www.notion.so/Ghasia-Fatema-F-204d9ba792184b0e9dca1f0739831162?pvs=21)",,Published🎉,,Microsaccades (https://www.notion.so/Microsaccades-19ccd07295344b9284fab3080c238f03?pvs=21),Research article,2019,

aEYE: A Deep Learning System for Video Nystagmus Detection,"Background: Nystagmus identification and interpretation is challenging for non-experts who lack specific training in neuro-ophthalmology or neuro-otology. This challenge is magnified when the task is performed via telemedicine. Deep learning models have not been heavily studied in video-based eye movement detection.
Methods: We developed, trained, and validated a deep-learning system (aEYE) to classify video recordings as normal or bearing at least two consecutive beats of nystagmus. The videos were retrospectively collected from a subset of the monocular (right eye) video-oculography (VOG) recording used in the Acute Video-oculography for Vertigo in Emergency Rooms for Rapid Triage (AVERT) clinical trial (#NCT02483429). Our model was derived from a preliminary dataset representing about 10% of the total AVERT videos (n = 435). The videos were trimmed into 10-sec clips sampled at 60 Hz with a resolution of 240 × 320 pixels. We then created 8 variations of the videos by altering the sampling rates (i.e., 30 Hz and 15 Hz) and image resolution (i.e., 60 × 80 pixels and 15 × 20 pixels). The dataset was labeled as “nystagmus” or “no nystagmus” by one expert provider. We then used a filtered image-based motion classification approach to develop aEYE. The model's performance at detecting nystagmus was calculated by using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.
Results: An ensemble between the ResNet-soft voting and the VGG-hard voting models had the best performing metrics. The AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 0.86, 88.4, 74.2, and 82.7%, respectively. Our validated folds had an average AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.86, 80.3, 80.9, and 80.4%, respectively. Models created from the compressed videos decreased in accuracy as image sampling rate decreased from 60 Hz to 15 Hz. There was only minimal change in the accuracy of nystagmus detection when decreasing image resolution and keeping sampling rate constant.
Conclusion: Deep learning is useful in detecting nystagmus in 60 Hz video recordings as well as videos with lower image resolutions and sampling rates, making it a potentially useful tool to aid future automated eye-movement enabled neurologic diagnosis.","Wagle, Narayani (https://www.notion.so/Wagle-Narayani-2d1dad6c3b974a9ab04c9cd09a12e316?pvs=21), Green, Kemar (https://www.notion.so/Green-Kemar-aeff744826f44aaf8b6fc0f85d88dccd?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Zee, David S (https://www.notion.so/Zee-David-S-a54d8115dd39404fa3fbe60216ee1f7c?pvs=21), Newman-Toker, David (https://www.notion.so/Newman-Toker-David-2f472e57d2d341598c1d5dd5bdb48240?pvs=21), Komogortsev, Oleg (https://www.notion.so/Komogortsev-Oleg-f14821617a8d46fcbabfbff2762ff6f5?pvs=21), Morkos, John (https://www.notion.so/Morkos-John-32d383f3b80546c2b9683ea0ccae3c28?pvs=21), Liu, Jingyan (https://www.notion.so/Liu-Jingyan-e5200c61e29242288c78c2f5f51d5849?pvs=21), Reith, Henry (https://www.notion.so/Reith-Henry-1373c74942584738a5da3099fb674683?pvs=21), Greenstein, Joseph (https://www.notion.so/Greenstein-Joseph-bab665abd6244475a74722516e6c73d9?pvs=21), Gong, Kirby (https://www.notion.so/Gong-Kirby-0990183e84944396a05ac0f0ca166e83?pvs=21), Gangan, Indranuj (https://www.notion.so/Gangan-Indranuj-2c9214053c234d2ab577c964b9e8fb88?pvs=21), Pakhomov, Daniil (https://www.notion.so/Pakhomov-Daniil-b6b6d0d1d98646c789fa93089e78884b?pvs=21), Hira, Sanchit (https://www.notion.so/Hira-Sanchit-5942377bc5354489bc611765cac60075?pvs=21), Winslow, Raimond (https://www.notion.so/Winslow-Raimond-6cb3250ea40c4e1aaf2b84259f706595?pvs=21)","Wagle, Green, Otero-Millan, Zee, Newman-Toker, Komogortsev, Morkos, Liu, Reith, Greenstein, Gong, Gangan, Pakhomov, Hira, Winslow",Measuring eye movements,"Front.

Eye and head movement recordings using smartphones for telemedicine applications: measurements of accuracy and precision,"Objective: Smartphones have shown promise in the assessment of neuro-ophthalmologic and vestibular disorders. We have shown that the head impulse test results recorded using our application are comparable with measurements from clinical video-oculography (VOG) goggles. The smartphone uses ARKit's capability to acquire eye and head movement positions without the need of performing a calibration as in most eye-tracking devices. Here, we measure the accuracy and precision of the eye and head position recorded using our application.
Methods: We enrolled healthy volunteers and asked them to direct their eyes, their heads, or both to targets on a wall at known eccentricities while recording their head and eye movements with our smartphone application. We measured the accuracy as the error between the eye or head movement measurement and the location of each target and the precision as the standard deviation of the eye or head position for each of the target positions.
Results: The accuracy of head recordings (15% error) was overall better than the accuracy of eye recordings (23% error). We also found that the accuracy for horizontal eye movements (17% error) was better than for vertical (27% error). Precision was also better for head movement (0.8 degrees) recordings than eye movement recordings (1.3 degrees) and variability tended to increase with eccentricity.
Conclusion: Our results provide basic metrics evaluating the utility of smartphone applications in the quantitative assessment of head and eye movements. While the new method may not replace the more accurate dedicated VOG devices, they provide a more accessible quantitative option. It may be advisable to include a calibration recording together with any planned clinical test to improve the accuracy.","Parker, Taylor Max  (https://www.notion.so/Parker-Taylor-Max-337b919484514136a42ec968d09effa9?pvs=21), Badihian, Shervin (https://www.notion.so/Badihian-Shervin-9af4a916b42446dc91ec7de929e5ecc3?pvs=21), Hasson, Ahmed (https://www.notion.so/Hasson-Ahmed-963d805822944e59bf55e3f83d8ea407?pvs=21), Saber Tehrani, Ali S (https://www.notion.so/Saber-Tehrani-Ali-S-6524c3f76bdc47a2bd273789d9f98810?pvs=21), Farrel, Nathan (https://www.notion.so/Farrel-Nathan-1368849949da4171a2523af893eb32b0?pvs=21), Newman-Toker, David (https://www.notion.so/Newman-Toker-David-2f472e57d2d341598c1d5dd5bdb48240?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21)","Parker, Badihian, Hasson, Saber Tehrani, Farrel, Newman-Toker, Otero-Millan","Diagnosis, Measuring eye movements","Front.

Vestibular Test Results in Patients With Horizontal Canal Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo,"Introduction
While the mechanism of posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is widely accepted as canalolithiasis, the pathophysiology of horizontal canal BPPV remains controversial. We seek to analyze vestibular test results of patients with horizontal canal BPPV with ageotropic nystagmus (AHC) and geotropic nystagmus (GHC) in comparison to patients with posterior canal BPPV (PC) to better understand its pathophysiology.
Methods
In a retrospective chart review of adults with BPPV at a tertiary referral balance center, we reviewed the clinical characteristics and compared videonystagmography, caloric, rotary chair, subjective visual vertical (SVV)/ subjective visual horizontal (SVH), and vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) results between groups.
Results
We included 11 AHC and seven GHC patients and randomly selected 20 PC patients as the comparison group. All groups had a high rate of migraine and low rates of diabetes and head trauma, but no difference between groups. Ipsilateral caloric weakness was more prevalent in the GHC group compared to the PC group (p=0.02). One of two AHC patients and both GHC patients who had SVV/SVH testing had abnormal findings. The only AHC patient who had ocular VEMP testing had abnormal results. Additionally, we observed a significant downbeating component to nystagmus (4 deg/sec or greater) exclusively in the AHC group (5/10 patients, p=0.001).
Conclusions
Patients with AHC and GHC have unique vestibular testing results. In particular, only AHC patients showed a downbeating component to their nystagmus, which may suggest utricular dysfunction in the pathophysiology of AHC.","Kim, Eric K (https://www.notion.so/Kim-Eric-K-683b9ea472dc47288fd68bcac8a7801e?pvs=21), Steenerson, Kristen K (https://www.notion.so/Steenerson-Kristen-K-73cd5564fd4a4205bb5e81ebbb9ce771?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Sharon, Jeffrey D (https://www.notion.so/Sharon-Jeffrey-D-1c42d6e2f21c4ce8a800745aba84e067?pvs=21)","Kim, Steenerson, Otero-Millan, Sharon",Diagnosis,Cureus 14(1): e21460,"July 28, 2021 10:46 AM",10.7759/cureus.21460,,,"Kim, Eric K (https://www.notion.so/Kim-Eric-K-683b9ea472dc47288fd68bcac8a7801e?pvs=21)",,Cureus,"January 20, 2022 1:59 PM",https://www.cureus.com/articles/82957-vestibular-test-results-in-patients-with-horizontal-canal-benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo,Head tilt eye movements,BPPV SVV,,,,,"January 20, 2022",,"Sharon, Jeffrey D (https://www.notion.so/Sharon-Jeffrey-D-1c42d6e2f21c4ce8a800745aba84e067?pvs=21)",,Published🎉,,Vestibular disorders (https://www.notion.so/Vestibular-disorders-bf0e3eef1e7e407990c3952beea773da?pvs=21),Research article,2022,

Modeling the effect of gravity on periodic alternating nystagmus,"Periodic alternating nystagmus (PAN) is a rare oscillatory ocular motor disorder. The effects of gravity on the dynamic behavior of PAN can be studied by monitoring the nystagmus while changing head orientation. Previous studies of patients with PAN reached different conclusions about the effect of changing the orientation of the head relative to gravity on the ongoing PAN, either no effect or a damping of the nystagmus within several minutes. What neuronal circuits could account for the difference in the effects of gravity among PAN patients? We modeled how the brain resolves the tilt-translation ambiguity in normal individuals and added an unstable, oscillatory vestibular system generating PAN. PAN was suppressed in our patient in ear-down positions, in a similar pattern to that of a previously reported patient. This effect was simulated by reducing the gain of the projection of the “rotation feedback” loop to the velocity-storage integrator to approximately 5% of its normal value. With normal “rotation feedback” PAN is expected to dissipate quickly as soon as the head is rotated away from upright position. Moreover, by disconnecting the rotation feedback completely (gain = zero) the model simulated PAN that was reported to be unaffected by gravity. Thus, understanding the effect of this single parameter, the gain of the rotation feedback, can explain the observed variability among our own and previous studies.","Shemesh, Ari (https://www.notion.so/Shemesh-Ari-a886476d06474e9dbe707e36c608b311?pvs=21), Kocoglu, Koray (https://www.notion.so/Kocoglu-Koray-409fffddbce94ee88a1f65ea12d2c760?pvs=21), Akdal, Gulden (https://www.notion.so/Akdal-Gulden-ff9f58a8f9e349999683aee74fae3b1f?pvs=21), Tumay Ala, Rahmi (https://www.notion.so/Tumay-Ala-Rahmi-c2f550f014c84f80947a6ce08594c5f2?pvs=21), Halmagyi, G.

Current concepts in acute vestibular syndrome and nystagmus detection,"Purpose of review
We present here neuro-otological tests using portable video-oculography (VOG) and strategies assisting physicians in the process of decision making beyond the classical ‘HINTS’ testing battery at the bedside.
Recent findings
Patients with acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) experience dizziness, gait unsteadiness and nausea/vomiting. A variety of causes can lead to this condition, including strokes. These patients cannot be adequately identified with the conventional approach by stratifying based on risk factors and symptom type. In addition to bedside methods such as HINTS and HINTS plus, quantitative methods for recording eye movements using VOG can augment the ability to diagnose and localize the lesion. In particular, the ability to identify and quantify the head impulse test (VOR gain, saccade metrics), nystagmus characteristics (waveform, beating direction and intensity), skew deviation, audiometry and lateropulsion expands our diagnostic capabilities. In addition to telemedicine, algorithms and artificial intelligence can be used to support emergency physicians and nonexperts in the future.
Summary
VOG, telemedicine and artificial intelligence may assist physicians in the diagnostic process of AVS patients.","Mantokoudis, Georgios (https://www.notion.so/Mantokoudis-Georgios-000bd9843aac410482e7436a64794d67?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Gold, Dan R (https://www.notion.so/Gold-Dan-R-3f7a72785d88433d8d3eb94a7055e782?pvs=21)","Mantokoudis, Otero-Millan, Gold",Diagnosis,Curr Opin Neurol. 2021 Dec 9.

The influence of scene tilt on saccade directions is amplitude dependent,"When exploring a visual scene, humans make more saccades in the horizontal direction than any other direction. While many have shown that the horizontal saccade bias rotates in response to scene tilt, it is unclear whether this effect depends on saccade amplitude. We addressed this question by examining the effect of image tilt on the saccade direction distributions recorded during freely viewing natural scenes. Participants (n = 20) viewed scenes tilted at −30°, 0°, and 30°. Saccade distributions during free viewing rotated by an angle of 12.1° ± 6.7° (t(19) = 8.04, p < 0.001) in the direction of the image tilt. When we partitioned the saccades according to their amplitude we found that small amplitude saccades occurred most in the horizontal direction while large amplitude saccades were more oriented to the scene tilt (p < 0.001). To further study the characteristics of small saccades and how they are affected by scene tilt, we looked at the effect of image tilt on small fixational saccades made while fixating a central target amidst a larger scene and found that fixational saccade distributions did not rotate with scene tilt (−0.3° ±1.7° degrees; t(19) = −0.8, p = 0.39). These results suggest a combined effect of two reference frames in saccade generation: one egocentric reference frame that dominates for small saccades, biases them horizontally, and may be common for different tasks, and another allocentric reference frame that biases larger saccades along the orientation of an image during free viewing.","Reeves, Stephanie (https://www.notion.so/Reeves-Stephanie-b7264776178f4767bb23e149d2fc3f19?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21)","Reeves, Otero-Millan",Ocular motor control,,"October 26, 2021 11:08 AM",10.1016/j.jns.2023.120635,,,"Reeves, Stephanie (https://www.notion.so/Reeves-Stephanie-b7264776178f4767bb23e149d2fc3f19?pvs=21)",,Journal of the Neurological Sciences,"June 10, 2024 9:41 AM",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X23000953,FEM,MicrosaccadesImageTilt,,,"https://www.notion.so/e62515c7db9d4b699311e625070c2c7b, https://www.notion.so/fe36c28ce4764d968b63a11202d226a6",,"March 26, 2023","Thaler 2013 (https://www.notion.so/Thaler-2013-c7c7817354ce46baba7404af3b080ec9?pvs=21), Bowers 2021 (https://www.notion.so/Bowers-2021-847d0fc77e7047b9ab5d318fa7276bc9?pvs=21), Thielen 2018 (https://www.notion.so/Thielen-2018-18d1314b6ea8428dbbb3d6fdfc24912c?pvs=21), Otero-Millan 2013 (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-2013-95993e6eb9ea493ab9bbf6c98367c8a1?pvs=21), Mergenthaler 2010 (https://www.notion.so/Mergenthaler-2010-b8b1ed20051a464d95446beb02487f24?pvs=21), Otero-Millan 2011 (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-2011-0442331a49444e86b49e72595537fdd5?pvs=21), Otero-Millan 2008 (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-2008-80c5d86efb71438db7e99319091d8471?pvs=21), Berg 2009 (https://www.notion.so/Berg-2009-e9d3e5624f7a486b812f5d890cc37b94?pvs=21), Hafed 2009 (https://www.notion.so/Hafed-2009-c9f3305b97c94fdd8d86ff72341514a2?pvs=21), McCamy 2013 (https://www.notion.so/McCamy-2013-28c5fa7a762a4d578c46fd30f1fbe32c?pvs=21), Hirasawa 2016 (https://www.notion.so/Hirasawa-2016-4f1802ad6f9342a4a0276cff60b94bc8?pvs=21), Williams 2019 (https://www.notion.so/Williams-2019-369a0efbd80343f7a1b4c969bf7a2f53?pvs=21), Hansen 2005 (https://www.notion.so/Hansen-2005-8cbadde009de420aa281bd9a586b001a?pvs=21), Kummerer et al 2022 (https://www.notion.so/Kummerer-et-al-2022-f87364f4fa4648a2b837a7aee7d84575?pvs=21), Le Meur & Coutrot 2016 (https://www.notion.so/Le-Meur-Coutrot-2016-473f675e1b0c42da8db5e643eb1752bd?pvs=21), Rolfs 2022 (https://www.notion.so/Rolfs-2022-4baaa6f1f7064de7b55957858953c064?pvs=21), Guyader 2017 (https://www.notion.so/Guyader-2017-4aa5f990fd5943fbbe847010b807b97e?pvs=21), Brecht 2004 (https://www.notion.so/Brecht-2004-5d6df4e583fd474ba43bcf7844a06062?pvs=21), Rothkegel 2019 (https://www.notion.so/Rothkegel-2019-3a79699437a84960a051d211c3f73a5b?pvs=21), Tatler 2006 (https://www.notion.so/Tatler-2006-31b71f96dc524907b6df5ec29ffcd2c5?pvs=21), Tatler 2005 (https://www.notion.so/Tatler-2005-5fbc8b765b5d41089647721e2891ca50?pvs=21), Frost & Poppel 1976 (https://www.notion.so/Frost-Poppel-1976-0e7a1297e33e4b1baa274ddcb3f055b3?pvs=21), Tatler 2009 (https://www.notion.so/Tatler-2009-ae98b6d0595f43d9b2d5fc905ac97a23?pvs=21), BlogPost: Saez 2017 (https://www.notion.so/BlogPost-Saez-2017-5e5bf84eb7454cec974899a1a9523fd9?pvs=21), Switkes 1978 (https://www.notion.so/Switkes-1978-c04f72cc32ae4bb485dbfa788e8af947?pvs=21), Samonds 2018 (https://www.notion.so/Samonds-2018-96093f150f4b4ea8a154ae78e4e9065f?pvs=21), Wismeijer 2012 (https://www.notion.so/Wismeijer-2012-e5b73dadd74747f69ed06da0023428f5?pvs=21), Sheehy 2019 (https://www.notion.so/Sheehy-2019-f67c72bdc150404ba4913be2e9b2467d?pvs=21), Pansell et al. 2006 (https://www.notion.so/Pansell-et-al-2006-34eeb3c1dde34bf4bd438d608bbeeeee?pvs=21), Groner 2008 (https://www.notion.so/Groner-2008-fe051d4289684bc6b1a699682a461099?pvs=21), Girshick 2011 (https://www.notion.so/Girshick-2011-a1174d6564df425abfa24c84b3147889?pvs=21), Kummerer 2016 (https://www.notion.so/Kummerer-2016-a1a6e00d504d4ef3aa994b961ca1a7e6?pvs=21), Cooper 2015 (https://www.notion.so/Cooper-2015-be6b775f4117470a999895b8ff332789?pvs=21), Jorges 2019 (https://www.notion.so/Jorges-2019-947b10d6623144a58c9e3f5422526ff2?pvs=21), Itti et al 1998 (https://www.notion.so/Itti-et-al-1998-3ea8b91e2fd5441994893943b671ca7a?pvs=21), Torralba 2003 (https://www.notion.so/Torralba-2003-43269897e5024fa981bac55571e759ac?pvs=21), Crawford 2003 (https://www.notion.so/Crawford-2003-1ab0244c12cf4c3bac1da7715bd7e220?pvs=21)","Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21)","October 13, 2021 → May 31, 2023",Published🎉,,Microsaccades (https://www.notion.so/Microsaccades-19ccd07295344b9284fab3080c238f03?pvs=21),Research article,2023,
Upbeat nystagmus with an unusual velocity-decreasing and increasing waveform: A sign of gaze-holding dysfunction in the paramedian tracts in the medulla?,"We report a patient with spontaneous upbeat nystagmus (UBN) due to an ischemic lesion involving the paramedian tract (PMT) in the medulla. Eye movement recordings, using an infrared video-oculography (VOG) system, showed that the slow phase of the nystagmus was initially velocity-decreasing but gradually became velocity-increasing. Simulation of the nystagmus with a mathematical model supports a role for the PMT in relaying premotor signals for vertical gaze holding to the cerebellum. Our model shows that the disruption in cerebellar input from PMT can lead to the velocity-increasing waveform of the nystagmus, whereas the velocity-decreasing waveform could be related to a mismatch between the innervational commands to the ocular muscles (the pulse and step) needed to hold gaze steady.","Tian, Jing (https://www.notion.so/Tian-Jing-5aea07edc0084c9ab2b2202b8544a8a8?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Zee, David S (https://www.notion.so/Zee-David-S-a54d8115dd39404fa3fbe60216ee1f7c?pvs=21), Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21)","Tian, Otero-Millan, Zee, Kheradmand","Diagnosis, Ocular motor control",Cerebellum (2022),"October 28, 2021 4:32 PM",10.1007/s12311-022-01376-6,,Tian2022_Article_UpbeatNystagmusWithAnUnusualVe.pdf,"Tian, Jing (https://www.notion.so/Tian-Jing-5aea07edc0084c9ab2b2202b8544a8a8?pvs=21)",,The Cerebellum,"August 11, 2022 11:51 AM",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12311-022-01376-6,Gaze holding,PMT case,,,,,"February 8, 2022",,"Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21)",,Published🎉,,Ocular motor control (https://www.notion.so/Ocular-motor-control-e62515c7db9d4b699311e625070c2c7b?pvs=21),Case report,2022,

"Measures of spatial orientation: Spatial bias analogues in visual and haptic tasks,","The primary sensory modality for probing spatial orientation can vary among psychophysical tasks. In the subjective visual vertical (SVV) task, a visual stimulus is used to measure perceived vertical orientation, while a haptic stimulus is used in the subjective haptic vertical (SHV) task. Here we examined disparity in SHV and SVV task results and asked whether it could be related to biases in probing different spatial estimates by each task. Forty-two healthy volunteers (mean ± SD age, 25 ± 10 years; 19 females; 21 left handed) were recruited. The effect of a task to measure spatial orientation was calculated as the difference between SHV and SVV values, and with the head upright and tilted 20° laterally. There was a task bias regardless of head position related to hand use in the haptic task but not handedness (mean head upright ± SEM: left hand, −3.7 ± 1.1°; right hand, 7.9 ± 1.0°). When this task bias was subtracted out, there was a similar spatial bias using each hand in the SHV task that was also comparable to the SVV task (mean head with left tilt: left hand, 3.9 ± 0.7°; right hand, 4.4 ± 0.7°; SVV, 4.9 ± 0.7°; mean head with right tilt: left hand, −4.6 ± 0.9°; right hand, −4.6 ± 0.8°; SVV, −4.7 ± 1.0°). These findings show that the disparity in visual and haptic measures of spatial orientation is primarily related to a modality-specific bias, and once the effect of hand use is removed from the haptic measurements, the spatial bias becomes comparable to the visual task.","Kim, Min Jung (https://www.notion.so/Kim-Min-Jung-3563d78567d243db964fde4d09915ef8?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21)","Kim, Otero-Millan, Kheradmand",Vision while moving,"eNeuro 9 August 2022, 9 (4)","July 27, 2022 9:57 AM",10.1523/ENEURO.0233-22.2022,,,"Kim, Min Jung (https://www.notion.so/Kim-Min-Jung-3563d78567d243db964fde4d09915ef8?pvs=21)",,eNeuro,"August 20, 2022 5:13 PM",https://www.eneuro.org/content/9/4/ENEURO.0233-22.2022,SVV mechanisms,,,,,,"August 9, 2022",,"Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21)",,Published🎉,,Haptic (https://www.notion.so/Haptic-a2ba42506f844a33bd450f37fba671af?pvs=21),Research article,2022,
Deep Learning Model for Static Ocular Torsion Detection Using Synthetically Generated Fundus Images,"Purpose: The objective of the study is to develop deep learning models using synthetic fundus images to assess the direction (intorsion versus extorsion) and amount (physiologic versus pathologic) of static ocular torsion. Static ocular torsion assessment is an important clinical tool for classifying vertical ocular misalignment; however, current methods are time-intensive with steep learning curves for frontline providers.
Methods: We used a dataset (n = 276) of right eye fundus images. The disc-foveal angle was calculated using ImageJ to generate synthetic images via image rotation. Using synthetic datasets (n = 12,740 images per model) and transfer learning (the reuse of a pretrained deep learning model on a new task), we developed a binary classifier (intorsion versus extorsion) and a multiclass classifier (physiologic versus pathologic intorsion and extorsion). Model performance was evaluated on unseen synthetic and nonsynthetic data.
Results: On the synthetic dataset, the binary classifier had an accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.92 and 0.98, respectively, whereas the multiclass classifier had an accuracy and AUROC of 0.77 and 0.94, respectively. The binary classifier generalized well on the nonsynthetic data (accuracy = 0.94; AUROC = 1.00).
Conclusions: The direction of static ocular torsion can be detected from synthetic fundus images using deep learning methods, which is key to differentiate between vestibular misalignment (skew deviation) and ocular muscle misalignment (superior oblique palsies).
Translational Relevance: Given the robust performance of our models on real fundus images, similar strategies can be adopted for deep learning research in rare neuro-ophthalmologic diseases with limited datasets.","Wang, Chen (https://www.notion.so/Wang-Chen-57c404366da34c6dacb856f4db4d471b?pvs=21), Bai, Yunong (https://www.notion.so/Bai-Yunong-230994eb659f4cc79a2f1a84b8a68f9d?pvs=21), Tsang, Ashley (https://www.notion.so/Tsang-Ashley-bc584b7837d044479bb846d4fb286db9?pvs=21), Bian, Yuhan (https://www.notion.so/Bian-Yuhan-946400b0a1644fc18645b11e185592c5?pvs=21), Gou, Yifan (https://www.notion.so/Gou-Yifan-f12ac41bc5bf4b22ae88e8bd6e2d32f6?pvs=21), Lin, Yan X (https://www.notion.so/Lin-Yan-X-a5f159c7c8174eb6ad0b9e2250309143?pvs=21), Zhao, Matthew (https://www.notion.so/Zhao-Matthew-e34193b8ba1345e880bcc637074c576c?pvs=21), Wei, Tony Y (https://www.notion.so/Wei-Tony-Y-0fc0a44bd3c746d78122fc4241e5c029?pvs=21), Desman, Jacob M (https://www.notion.so/Desman-Jacob-M-530111b22e044060bb9638335c0c6fa1?pvs=21), Taylor, Casey Overby (https://www.notion.so/Taylor-Casey-Overby-fea4ebd79ae9411693ecfa449293aa8d?pvs=21), Greenstein, Joseph (https://www.notion.so/Greenstein-Joseph-bab665abd6244475a74722516e6c73d9?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Liu, Tin Yan Alvin (https://www.notion.so/Liu-Tin-Yan-Alvin-d49025c7d9b64799b05f2c452d936646?pvs=21), Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21), Zee, David S (https://www.notion.so/Zee-David-S-a54d8115dd39404fa3fbe60216ee1f7c?pvs=21), Green, Kemar (https://www.notion.so/Green-Kemar-aeff744826f44aaf8b6fc0f85d88dccd?pvs=21)","Wang, Bai, Tsang, Bian, Gou, Lin, Zhao, Wei, Desman, Taylor, Greenstein, Otero-Millan, Liu, Kheradmand, Zee, Green","Diagnosis, Measuring eye movements","Translational Vision Science & Technology January 2023, Vol.12, 17.","August 9, 2022 11:11 AM",https://doi.org/10.1167/tvst.12.1.17,,,"Wang, Chen (https://www.notion.so/Wang-Chen-57c404366da34c6dacb856f4db4d471b?pvs=21)",,tvst,"January 11, 2023 3:11 PM",https://tvst.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2785277,Diagnostics,deep fundus,,,,,"January 11, 2023",,"Green, Kemar (https://www.notion.so/Green-Kemar-aeff744826f44aaf8b6fc0f85d88dccd?pvs=21)","August 1, 2021 → January 11, 2023",Published🎉,,Diagnosis (https://www.notion.so/Diagnosis-dd0da3ca4a8a4aa689a28fb2c70ec623?pvs=21),Research article,2023,

Distortion of perceived visual space after prolonged horizontal eccentric gaze holding,"Eye movements have long been used as a measure of underlying brain function and pathology. Specifically, rebound nystagmus has provided a behavioral window into the adaptive mechanisms of gaze holding. It is an eye movement aftereffect resulting from maintaining gaze eccentrically for a prolonged duration. Upon returning to central fixation, the eyes drift or ""rebound"" back toward the previously held gaze location, demonstrating an adaptive process. Little is known about how prolonged eccentric gaze holding, and the accompanying adaptation of the oculomotor system, influences the perception of visual space. Here, we used a variant of the landmark task to assess spatial bias (or lack thereof) with and without prior eccentric gaze holding. We found that perceived spatial bias after prolonged eccentric gaze holding was significantly different between gaze holding to the far left (-40 deg) and the far right (+40 deg). We also found that sensitivity in distinguishing relative distances between objects in space was marginally different between the left and right gaze holding conditions. This suggests that perceived visual space is differentially impacted by where gaze was previously held, reflecting a dependence on the history of eye positions.","Tyson, Terence (https://www.notion.so/Tyson-Terence-8c201b26d08b4c3da5e7100ba5a5498e?pvs=21), Perez, Dennis F (https://www.notion.so/Perez-Dennis-F-371545ee8b3b46c8ac3dabfe4bdb58de?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21)","Tyson, Perez, Otero-Millan",Vision while moving,Vision Res;240:108729,"November 13, 2022 4:17 PM",10.1016/j.visres.2025.108729,,,"Tyson, Terence (https://www.notion.so/Tyson-Terence-8c201b26d08b4c3da5e7100ba5a5498e?pvs=21)",,Vision Research,"December 22, 2025 4:49 PM",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698925001907,Gaze holding,,,41380491,,"Experiment Testing (https://www.notion.so/Experiment-Testing-7f56df97074d428bb173bad0d040d446?pvs=21), Data Collection (https://www.notion.so/Data-Collection-7d3ed6a74afa446c8c5fbe9bedc334be?pvs=21), Data Analysis (https://www.notion.so/Data-Analysis-baf3e9d5db5a4fe4ac312de3891d9760?pvs=21), Abstract Writeup (SfN or Optica) (https://www.notion.so/Abstract-Writeup-SfN-or-Optica-4bc6976047054ae996a4adadac681fc2?pvs=21)","December 10, 2025","McCourt, 2000 (https://www.notion.so/McCourt-2000-467268fd81cf4a4ebcb79a920806ef25?pvs=21), Ross et al, 1997 (https://www.notion.so/Ross-et-al-1997-ebb4ebd5ea2540cb8ef0fd6dcf65bd63?pvs=21)","Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21)",,Published🎉,"Terence Tyson, Dennis Perez, Jorge Otero-Millan, Tiffany lau",Perceptual Stability (https://www.notion.so/Perceptual-Stability-9a1d831dab9441139ba739a6fd9b22c6?pvs=21),Research article,2025,

"Measuring the Influence of Magnetic Vestibular Stimulation on Reflexive Eye-Movements, Self-Motion Perception, and Cognitive Performance in a 7 T MRT","Strong magnetic fields induce dizziness, vertigo, and nystagmus due to Lorentz forces acting on the cupula in the semi-circular canals, an effect called magnetic vestibular stimulation (MVS). In this article, we present an experimental setup in a 7T MRT scanner (MRI scanner) that allows the investigation of the influence of strong magnetic fields on nystagmus as well as perceptual and cognitive responses. The strength of MVS is manipulated by altering the head positions of the participants. The orientation of the participants' semicircular canals with respect to the static magnetic field is assessed by combining a 3D magnetometer and 3D constructive interference in steady-state (3D-CISS) images. This approach allows to account for intra- and inter-individual differences in participants’ responses to MVS. In the future, MVS can be useful for clinical research, for example, in the investigation of compensatory processes in vestibular disorders. Furthermore, it could foster insights into the interplay between vestibular information and cognitive processes in terms of spatial cognition and the emergence of self-motion percepts under conflicting sensory information. In fMRI studies, MVS can elicit a possible confounding effect, especially in tasks influenced by vestibular information or in studies comparing vestibular patients with healthy controls.","Wyssen, Gerda (https://www.notion.so/Wyssen-Gerda-e6bdcae540d7422f90da9bf920a40b76?pvs=21), Mast, Fred W (https://www.notion.so/Mast-Fred-W-dfa3d46f49ae4bbab1cf9c137f2b01ad?pvs=21), Mantokoudis, Georgios (https://www.notion.so/Mantokoudis-Georgios-000bd9843aac410482e7436a64794d67?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Morrison, Miranda (https://www.notion.so/Morrison-Miranda-2d680957bb094217802d8ff791e364e2?pvs=21), Korda, Athanasia (https://www.notion.so/Korda-Athanasia-5d6ab448785c48749caf197cc7060d1a?pvs=21), Wimmer, Wilhelm (https://www.notion.so/Wimmer-Wilhelm-75355046cdd9469aba0a6496316260a2?pvs=21), Ertl, Matthias (https://www.notion.so/Ertl-Matthias-bdbd078cbb3d4e55bc44fca94753eee1?pvs=21), Szukics, Andreas A (https://www.notion.so/Szukics-Andreas-A-2e9593a4a09044d29d3bfc2846c6bcfe?pvs=21), Wyss, Thomas (https://www.notion.so/Wyss-Thomas-acaa856755ce41aa981950cfe1a74182?pvs=21), Wagner, Franca (https://www.notion.so/Wagner-Franca-de815e0d6d4b47f8becbbe8f47ddc17a?pvs=21), Caversaccio, Marco D (https://www.notion.so/Caversaccio-Marco-D-3fb0c3a533da48c981777fc82fee5c0e?pvs=21)","Wyssen, Mast, Mantokoudis, Otero-Millan, Morrison, Korda, Wimmer, Ertl, Szukics, Wyss, Wagner, Caversaccio",Measuring eye movements,"J.

Video ocular counter-roll (vOCR): Otolith-ocular function and compensatory effect of neck following vestibular loss,"Objective
Assessment of recovery following vestibular loss has been limited by the lack of bedside measures in clinical settings. Here, we used the video ocular counter-roll (vOCR) test to study otolith-ocular function and compensatory effect of neck proprioception in patients at different stages of vestibular loss.
Study Design
Case-control study.
Setting
Tertiary care center.
Methods
Fifty-six subjects were recruited including patients with acute (9 ± 2 days [mean ± standard error of mean]), subacute (61 ± 11 days), and chronic (1009 ± 266 days) unilateral loss of vestibular function, as well as a group of healthy controls. We used a video-oculography method based on tracking the iris for vOCR measurement. To examine the effect of neck inputs, vOCR was recorded during two simple tilt maneuvers in all subjects while seated: 30° head-on-body tilt and 30° head-and-body tilt.
Results
The vOCR responses evolved at different stages following vestibular loss with improvement of the gains in the chronic stage. The deficit was more pronounced when the whole body was tilted (acute: 0.08 ± 0.01, subacute: 0.11 ± 0.01, chronic: 0.13 ± 0.02, healthy control: 0.18 ± 0.01), and the gain of vOCR improved when the head was tilted on the body (acute: 0.11 ± 0.01, subacute: 0.14 ± 0.01, chronic: 0.13 ± 0.02, healthy control: 0.17 ± 0.01). The time course of vOCR response was affected as well with reduced amplitude and slower response in the acute stage of vestibular loss.
Conclusion
The vOCR test can be valuable as a clinical marker to measure vestibular recovery and compensatory effect of neck proprioception in patients at different stages following loss of vestibular function.","Yang, Yuchen (https://www.notion.so/Yang-Yuchen-098bbe78dbd745618980f1aad26eed1c?pvs=21), Tian, Jing (https://www.notion.so/Tian-Jing-5aea07edc0084c9ab2b2202b8544a8a8?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Schubert, Michael (https://www.notion.so/Schubert-Michael-be9dd5934032430296fbd811266b54c6?pvs=21), Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21)","Yang, Tian, Otero-Millan, Schubert, Kheradmand",Diagnosis,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2023 Mar 2,"January 27, 2023 3:00 PM",10.1002/ohn.304,,,"Yang, Yuchen (https://www.notion.so/Yang-Yuchen-098bbe78dbd745618980f1aad26eed1c?pvs=21)",,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"March 27, 2023 9:23 PM",https://aao-hnsfjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ohn.304,"Diagnostics, Head tilt eye movements",,,,https://www.notion.so/e62515c7db9d4b699311e625070c2c7b,,"March 2, 2023",,"Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21)","March 2, 2018 → March 2, 2023",Published🎉,,Torsion (https://www.notion.so/Torsion-349efb631fa94f8381104b32760d2079?pvs=21),Research article,2023,

Open Iris - An Open Source Framework for Video-Based Eye-Tracking Research and Development,"Eye-tracking is an essential tool in many fields, yet existing solutions are often limited for customized applications due to cost or lack of flexibility. We present OpenIris, an adaptable and user-friendly open-source framework for video-based eye-tracking. OpenIris is developed in C# with modular design that allows further extension and customization through plugins for different hardware systems, tracking, and calibration pipelines. It can be remotely controlled via a network interface from other devices or programs. Eye movements can be recorded online from camera stream or offline post-processing recorded videos. Example plugins have been developed to track eye motion in 3-D, including torsion. Currently implemented binocular pupil tracking pipelines can achieve frame rates of more than 500Hz. With the OpenIris framework, we aim to fill a gap in the research tools available for high-precision and high-speed eye-tracking, especially in environments that require custom solutions that are not currently well-served by commercial eye-trackers.","Sadeghi, Roksana (https://www.notion.so/Sadeghi-Roksana-0062b93c180840e1bf7dff7c0569aabe?pvs=21), Ressmeyer, Ryan (https://www.notion.so/Ressmeyer-Ryan-94ace25531054f93be7c0b3d4d5aec34?pvs=21), Yates, Jacob (https://www.notion.so/Yates-Jacob-5259f8ab0bbf4943865c59c817d85b6a?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21)","Sadeghi, Ressmeyer, Yates, Otero-Millan",Measuring eye movements,"ETRA '24: Proceedings of the 2024 Symposium on Eye Tracking Research and Applications June 2024 Article No.: 17, Pages 1 - 7","March 21, 2023 11:37 AM",https://doi.org/10.1145/3649902.3653348,,,"Sadeghi, Roksana (https://www.notion.so/Sadeghi-Roksana-0062b93c180840e1bf7dff7c0569aabe?pvs=21)",,ETRA,"June 28, 2024 10:04 PM",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3649902.3653348#,Eye tracking,openiris,,,,,"June 4, 2024",Otero-Millan et al 2015 (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-et-al-2015-6f48712bd0454551bde85b42986a1354?pvs=21),"Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21)","June 4, 2023 → June 4, 2024",Published🎉,,Eye tracking (https://www.notion.so/Eye-tracking-4be05eee214f43779ec0b220e6990df3?pvs=21),Methods,2024,

Video ocular counter roll: A bedside test of otolith-ocular function,Here we review the clinical value of a video-oculography test for clinical evaluation of vestibular otolith function. This test is known as the video ocular counter roll (vOCR) and is based on measurement of torsional vestibulo-ocular reflex with a lateral head tilt. The vOCR test consists of a simple maneuver during which the head and torso are tilted en bloc by the examiner. The pattern of vOCR deficit among patients highlights its clinical value in identifying the stage of vestibular loss and recovery. The quick application of vOCR allows examination of otolith-ocular function and assessment of vestibular recovery at the bedside.,"Yang, Yuchen (https://www.notion.so/Yang-Yuchen-098bbe78dbd745618980f1aad26eed1c?pvs=21), Tian, Jing (https://www.notion.so/Tian-Jing-5aea07edc0084c9ab2b2202b8544a8a8?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21)","Yang, Tian, Otero-Millan, Kheradmand",Diagnosis,Ann Clin Transl Neurol. 2023 Dec;10(12):2426-2429.,"August 17, 2023 4:50 PM",https://doi.org/10.1002/acn3.51921,,,"Yang, Yuchen (https://www.notion.so/Yang-Yuchen-098bbe78dbd745618980f1aad26eed1c?pvs=21)",,Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology,"December 26, 2023 9:46 AM",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acn3.51921,Diagnostics,miniVOCR,,10723232,https://www.notion.so/e62515c7db9d4b699311e625070c2c7b,,"October 13, 2023",,"Kheradmand, Amir (https://www.notion.so/Kheradmand-Amir-0a192265047548b884afb499984b990d?pvs=21)","December 26, 2021 → December 26, 2023",Published🎉,,Torsion (https://www.notion.so/Torsion-349efb631fa94f8381104b32760d2079?pvs=21),,2023,

A method for measuring closed-loop latency in gaze-contingent rendering without extra equipment,"In gaze-contingent rendering, the visual stimulus rendered on a display changes based on where the observer is looking. This technique allows researchers to achieve dynamic control over stimulus placement on the retina in the presence of eye movements and is often used to investigate how sensory processing and perception vary across the visual field. Precise stimulus placement using gaze-contingent rendering depends on minimizing the temporal latency between a change in the observer's gaze position, measured using an eye tracker, and the corresponding change to the stimulus. This latency, however, can be challenging to measure reliably. Here, we present a simple method for measuring system latency that requires no additional hardware beyond the eye tracker and display, which are already part of the gaze-contingent system. Two small circles are rendered on the display to simulate the appearance of two pupils. The eye tracker is pointed towards the display to record both pupils simultaneously. One pupil is drawn based on a pre-determined trajectory, for example, moving up and down at a constant speed. The second pupil is ""gaze-contingent"": it is drawn based on the measured position of the first pupil. The time-lag at which the position of the second pupil matches the first pupil gives the closed-loop latency of the entire system. To validate this method, we added artificial rendering delays to our system and produced measured latencies that precisely corresponded to predictions, given the refresh rate of the display. This method provides a simple, low-cost way of precisely quantifying gaze-contingent rendering latencies, with no additional hardware required.","Anderson, Matthew D (https://www.notion.so/Anderson-Matthew-D-6a96c2b2e59d47e0aecdbb35c6b8c688?pvs=21), Cooper, Emily (https://www.notion.so/Cooper-Emily-4bca3548c3dc485bae2f8e760bf944b6?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21)","Anderson, Cooper, Otero-Millan",Measuring eye movements,Behav Res Methods;58(1):16,"July 17, 2025 3:17 PM",10.3758/s13428-025-02864-3,,,,,Behavior Research Methods,"December 22, 2025 4:42 PM",https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-025-02864-3,Eye tracking,,,41339573,,,"December 3, 2025",,"Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21)",,Published🎉,,Methods (https://www.notion.so/Methods-761b9ded752849f3b7156f425fb9c930?pvs=21),Methods,2025,New project for publication (https://www.notion.so/New-project-for-publication-23372fb2131a81a1b7b9d1ceefbdeca9?pvs=21)

"A Pilot Study of Smartphone Eye Tracking for Detection of Positional Nystagmus ","Introduction: Detecting positional nystagmus is essential for diagnosing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Therefore, developing methods to streamline this diagnosis can improve timely patient management and help prevent unnecessary emergency department visits. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of a smartphone eye-tracking application in quantifying eye movements during positional testing to detect positional nystagmus. Methods: We recruited patients with positional dizziness suspected of having BPPV from the vestibular rehabilitation clinic and the consult service for dizzy patients (Tele-Dizzy) at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Using an in-house smartphone app (EyePhone), we recorded eye movements during the Dix-Hallpike and supine roll tests. Two expert clinicians reviewed the videos, and a third one adjudicated the disagreements. Eye position data obtained from the EyePhone app were analyzed with an embedded algorithm to identify positional nystagmus. Using the adjudicated expert review as the reference standard, we evaluated EyePhone’s accuracy in detecting positional nystagmus by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. Results: We recruited ten participants, 60% women, with an average age of 61.8 years. We reviewed 23 positional eye movement videos of participants while undergoing positional testing. The final adjudicated expert review identified positional nystagmus in 3 (13%) videos. The phone application traces indicated nystagmus in all 3 of these videos (sensitivity = 100% [95% CI = 44–100%]) and correctly ruled it out in 20 traces (specificity = 100% [95% CI = 84–100%]). The app demonstrated a positive predictive value of 100% (95% CI = 43–100%) and a negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI = 84–100%). Conclusions: This small pilot study shows proof-of-concept that a smartphone eye-tracking app without special phone attachments can detect positional nystagmus.

Modeling of magnetic vestibular stimulation experienced during high-field clinical MRI,"Background
High-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful diagnostic tool but can induce unintended physiological effects, such as nystagmus and dizziness, potentially compromising the comfort and safety of individuals undergoing imaging. These effects likely result from the Lorentz force, which arises from the interaction between the MRI's static magnetic field and electrical currents in the inner ear. Yet, the Lorentz force hypothesis fails to explain observed eye movement patterns in healthy adults fully. This study explores these effects and tests whether the Lorentz force hypothesis adequately explains magnetic vestibular stimulation.

Methods
We developed a mathematical model integrating computational fluid dynamics, fluid-structure interaction solvers, and magnetohydrodynamic equations to simulate the biomechanical response of the cristae ampullares. Using high-resolution micro-CT data of the human membranous labyrinth, we ensured anatomical accuracy. Experimental validation involved measuring horizontal, vertical, and torsional slow-phase eye movements in healthy subjects exposed to varying magnetic field intensities and head positions.

Results
Our model accurately replicates observed nystagmus patterns, predicting slow-phase eye velocities that match experimental data. Results indicate that Lorentz force-induced stimulation of individual cupulae explains variability in eye movements across different magnetic field intensities and head orientations.

Conclusions
This study empirically supports the Lorentz force hypothesis as a valid explanation for magnetic vestibular stimulation, offering new insights into the effects of high-field MRI on the vestibular system. These findings provide a foundation for future research and improved clinical practices.","Aran-Tapia, Ismael (https://www.notion.so/Aran-Tapia-Ismael-2ae72fb2131a808ea7cace75d99791a5?pvs=21), Perez-Muñuzuri, Alberto (https://www.notion.so/Perez-Mu-uzuri-Alberto-2ae72fb2131a80cebfd5d8f8f95aebff?pvs=21), Soto-Varela, Andres (https://www.notion.so/Soto-Varela-Andres-2ae72fb2131a80e8bc65f8b76ce27616?pvs=21), Otero-Millan, Jorge (https://www.notion.so/Otero-Millan-Jorge-daeb57d4207e4ebab00ca05473e1cbdb?pvs=21), Roberts, Dale C (https://www.notion.so/Roberts-Dale-C-1095dbbb31614cf49f3a8924321165b6?pvs=21), Ward, Bryan K (https://www.notion.so/Ward-Bryan-K-4f440f4f82b64b5faf9300fa9ab9bae5?pvs=21)","Aran-Tapia, Perez-Muñuzuri, Soto-Varela, Otero-Millan, Roberts, Ward",Vision while moving,"Commun Med 5, 27 (2025)","November 17, 2025 11:41 AM",10.1038/s43856-024-00667-9,,,"Aran-Tapia, Ismael (https://www.notion.so/Aran-Tapia-Ismael-2ae72fb2131a808ea7cace75d99791a5?pvs=21)",,Communications medicine,"November 17, 2025 11:44 AM",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-024-00667-9,VOR adaptation,,,,,,"January 21, 2025",,"Ward, Bryan K (https://www.notion.so/Ward-Bryan-K-4f440f4f82b64b5faf9300fa9ab9bae5?pvs=21)",,Published🎉,,,Research article,2025,New project for publication (https://www.notion.so/New-project-for-publication-2ae72fb2131a8142a541c2d66aa88ab2?pvs=21)
Feasibility of Using Smartphone Eye Tracking for Self-Recording Positional Tests ,"Introduction: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common cause of dizziness that is diagnosed by detecting nystagmus through positional maneuvers. Limited access to expert clinicians to correctly perform and interpret the eye movement findings of positional tests can hamper the diagnosis and delay the treatment. We aimed to assess the usability of a smartphone-based eye-tracking application (EyePhone) for self-recording eye movements during positional testing. Methods: Healthy volunteers were enrolled and provided instructions to perform Dix-Hallpike and Supine Roll tests using the EyePhone application to record themselves. A study team member was instructed to observe the process without interfering. They recorded the time each section took and the accuracy of performing positional tests. Usability was assessed using the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (MAUQ), and expert evaluation of recorded videos determined quality. Results: All participants successfully performed the tests and recorded their eye movements. On average, after watching the instruction, it took participants 3 min 31 s to record the Dix-Hallpike test and 3 min 4 s to record the Supine Roll test. Nine participants completed Dix-Hallpike without major errors, and all completed the Supine Roll successfully. An expert review found that 95% of videos had clear eye visibility. Participants rated the app as easy to use and stated that they would use the app again. Conclusion: We demonstrated the usability and feasibility of the EyePhone app for self-recording positional tests. This application offers the potential for remote BPPV diagnosis and improved patient access to care.

Spontaneous Nystagmus Violating the Alexander’s Law: Neural Substrates and Mechanisms,"Alexander’s law states that spontaneous nystagmus increases when looking in the direction of fast-phase and decreases during gaze in slow-phase direction. Disobedience to Alexander’s law is occasionally observed in central nystagmus, but the underlying neural circuit mechanisms are poorly understood. In a retrospective analysis of 2,652 patients with posterior circulations stroke, we found a violation of Alexander’s law in one or both directions of lateral gaze in 17 patients with lesions of unilateral lateral medulla affecting the vestibular nucleus. Patients with vestibular neuritis served as a control. When Alexander’s law is violated, the time constant (Tc) was larger than that in the controls (median [interquartile range, IQR]: 14.4s [6.4–38.9] vs 9.0s [IQR 5.5–12.6], p = 0.036) while the Tc did not differ between the groups when Alexander’ law is obeyed (9.6s [3.6–16.1] vs 9.0s [5.5–12.6], p = 0.924). To test the study hypothesis that an unstable neural integrator may generate nystagmus violating Alexander’s law, we utilized the gaze-holding neural integrator model incorporating brainstem leaky neural integrator and negative velocity feedback loop via the cerebellum. The lesion-induced changes included false rotational cue, primarily attributed to central vestibular imbalance, and unstable neural integrator, examined in two ways: hyperexcitable brainstem neural integrator and paradoxical excitatory effect of Purkinje cells. With normal integrator function, the false rotational cue generated nystagmus consistent with Alexander’s law. However, both types of unstable neural integrators tested produced nystagmus that violated Alexander’s law. We propose that when the neural integrator is unstable with lesions in the brainstem neural integrator itself or the neural synapse between Purkinje cells and the brainstem vestibular nucleus, nystagmus violates Alexander’s law. The spontaneous nystagmus violating Alexander’s law may be the useful clue for identifying central vestibular syndrome.
